After a poor initial response, President Bush seems finally to be getting disaster assistance to those in need.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was apparently caught completely unprepared by Hurricane Andrew.
Bush, in a brief but poignant address from the Oval Office, committed the government to pay for disaster relief.
He also pledged to rebuild Homestead AFB, a major area employer.
The arrival in Florida of the military and the attention of Mr. James Baker and Transportation Secretary Andrew Card have helped greatly.
While Bush's actions enabled him to gain politically, his election rival, Bill Clinton, could do little more than offer sympathy.
