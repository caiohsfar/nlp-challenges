On Sunday, a two-seat, T-2 Buckeye jet trainer crashed on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier Lexington in the Gulf of Mexico killing five people and injuring at least two.
The crash also did major damage to two aircraft on the flight deck and minor damage to a third.
The T-2 was assigned to Training Squadron 19, Meridian, Mississippi.
Several fires caused by the crash were quickly brought under control.
The Navy, concerned that fuel cells aboard a jet might explode, brought in a team of ordinance experts from Panama City.
The Navy uses the 46-year-old Lexington exclusively for training.
