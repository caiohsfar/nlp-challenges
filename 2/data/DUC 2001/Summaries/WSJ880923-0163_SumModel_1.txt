Controversy exists as to what is best: allowing natural reforestation after a forest fire, or promoting human intervention to speed up "getting the forest green again."
In either case, everyone agrees that post-fire recovery enables more and different plant, bird and animal species to flourish in the forest for about 40 years until it again matures and canopies over.
Also controversial is The National Park Service's 16-year-old "natural burn" policy, which allows lightening-caused forest fires to burn themselves out, except where they threaten towns or park buildings.
Critics claim it was this policy that enabled fires to destroy half of Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres.
