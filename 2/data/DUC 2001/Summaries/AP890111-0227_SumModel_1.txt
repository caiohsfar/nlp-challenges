The new year ushers in a new wildfire season in Cooke City, Montana while residents reflect on last season's wildfires in the tourist town on the northeastern corner of Yellowstone National Park.
For two months last summer the citizens of Cooke City and its tiny suburb, Silver Gate, were showcased on the nightly TV news splashed across the front pages of the nation's newspapers as forest fires threatened to burn them out.
Their economically critical summer tourist season a bust and the hunting season crippled had to wait until mid-September to pick up the pieces.
The residents hope to never go through another summer like the last one.
