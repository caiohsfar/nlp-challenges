Foresters say the heavy rains that have pelted California in the past two weeks have worsened the threat of fierce forest fires this summer because they will stimulate the growth of grasses.
The grasses will turn paper-dry by July helping to spread fires quickly through trees and brush killed and weakened by five consecutive years of drought and by insects which more easily invade dry wood than moist.
Other states at risk of severe fires takes in about a third of the United States mainland, including Oregon and Washington east of the Cascades and much of Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana and the Dakotas.
