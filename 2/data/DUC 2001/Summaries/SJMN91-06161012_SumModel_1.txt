The big island of Hawaii and the southern part of Mexico's Baja Peninsula are being touted as the best viewing areas for the July 11 eclipse.
Statistics indicate that they offer the best chance of cloudless skies.
The largest cities in Mexico, Guadalajara and Mexico City, will also be in the path of total eclipse.
The eclipse will also be visible from much of western North and South America, but only a small swath of the continents will see a total blackout of the sun.
Would-be viewers who want to go to Mexico or Hawaii are having a hard time arranging travel.
