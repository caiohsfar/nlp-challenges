De Beers' Venetia mine began production in 1992, and was the first new diamond mine to open in South Africa in 25 years.
Production was curtailed for a while after opening when the De Beers' selling cartel imposed quotas on producers because of a flood of gems from Angola, and uncertainty about Russian exports.
Last year the mines output doubled.
About 70 percent of Ventia's diamonds are of gem quality, and annual production is expected to reach 500 million dollars.
That production will help the De Beers' marketing arm to maintain control of the marketing of the world's output of rough gem diamonds.
