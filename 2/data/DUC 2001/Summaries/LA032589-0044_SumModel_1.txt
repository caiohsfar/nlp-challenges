An Exxon oil tanker ran aground on a reef Friday about 25 miles from the city of Valdez spilling about 8.4 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound at a reported rate of 10,000 barrels per hour.
There were no reports of injuries to people aboard the ship or to wildlife.
Local residents and environmentalists complained about the slow pace of the cleanup, noting that the slick was huge, looked devastating, and would affect everything in the food chain.
The spill is expected too add fuel to a campaign by environmentalists to prevent further oil development in Alaska.
