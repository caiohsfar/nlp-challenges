A lengthy statement attributed to the imprisoned Shining Path leadership raises new doubts over a call for peace.
The statement, published recently in a leading opposition newspaper, provides what appears to be a strategic rationale for the peace proposal made by the insurgents last fall.
While the newspaper has accepted the document as an authentic call for peace by the Shining Path, the paper has also stressed that the peace called for in the statement is nothing more than a temporary tactical retreat by the Shining Path leaders and is not, as President Alberto Fujimori has contended, an implicit admission of defeat.
