Tetsuya Fujita, a science professor at the University of Chicago, is one of the world's foremost authorities on tornadoes.
Today, 1 July 1990, one would probably find Fujita in his laboratory seeking new data about the workings of tornadoes.
He simulates miniature tornadoes with the use of fans, adding steam to make the results visible.
Fujita has helped to define the conditions that develop tornadoes and he originated a scale for measuring their intensity.
Fujita identified air currents called microbursts which have caused air crashes.
He convinced the FAA to deploy doppler radar that detects microbursts and thus aircraft can be redirected.
