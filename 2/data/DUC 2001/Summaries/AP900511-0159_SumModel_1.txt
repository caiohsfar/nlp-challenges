Earlier this week Elizabeth Taylor's publicist said that the Oscar-winning actress was improving and would soon be released from the hospital.
Ms. Taylor won Oscars for her performances in "Butterfield 8" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"
.
Since that announcement recovery of the actress was dealt a setback when she contracted bacterial pneumonia and developed a yeast infection that will keep her hospitalized for another six weeks.
She is now occupying one of the hospital's suites.
Her four children have visited her throughout her hospitalization.
Michael Jackson has also paid a visit.
