The Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the FBI are investigating a videotaped incident in which a white Long Beach police officer appeared to shove a black man's face into a plate glass window after a routine traffic stop.
The FBI has also been called in to determine whether the civil rights of the man who was arrested "Don Jackson, a sergeant on administrative leave for the Hawthorne Police Department" were violated.
The accused officer, Mark Dickey, who had been cleared of a prior misconduct charge has been reassigned from patrol duty to the detective bureau while the investigation continues.
