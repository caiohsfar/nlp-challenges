President Alberto Fujimori has admitted that talks are being held between government representatives and Shining Path leaders in prison, according to a report on the Lima- based television program "Sunday Review."
The main points of a peace agreement between the two would be the surrender of weapons and a general amnesty.
The peace talks are being led by Abimael Guzman, the Shining Path founder who has been serving a life sentence since October 1992.
The 10-point agreement says its main goal is to "stop the popular war with its four forms of fighting: terrorism, selective murders, sabotage, and armed agitation and propaganda."
