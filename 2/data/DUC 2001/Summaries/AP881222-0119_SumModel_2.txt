Meteorologists often attribute the 1988 drought in North America to the northward displacement of the jet stream, which similarly displaced northward the storms that track along its path.
However, researchers from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Camp Springs, Md. say that what we should know is why the jet stream was displaced northward.
They say the shift was caused by temperature abnormalities near the equator in the Pacific.
If their computer models hold true and such weather abnormalities can be predicted, then perhaps we can also predict droughts.
