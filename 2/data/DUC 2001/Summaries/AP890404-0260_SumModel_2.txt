Exxon crews Tuesday finished pumping oil out of the tanker Exxon Valdez and will attempt to move the vessel to a remote cove for repairs.
The family of the fired Exxon Valdez captain, Joseph Hazelwood, said that skipper wants to surrender to face criminal charges pending advice from his lawyer.
He is accused of operating the ship while under the influence of alcohol, reckless endangerment, and negligent discharge of oil.
A multi-million dollar class-action lawsuit was filed in federal court in California against Exxon Corp., charging that the spill has led to gas prices of 10 to 15 cents more a gallon.
