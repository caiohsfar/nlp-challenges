The Coast Guard Commandant Paul Yost, the top federal official tracking the Exxon plan to clean up the Alaskan oil spill, said the plan was poorly drafted and lacking in specifics.
He did not reject it, saying he wanted to meet with Exxon and state officials.
Consumer activist Ralph Nader and others blasted Exxon for failing to be prepared for the spill and not rapidly responding to the accident.
They also questioned increases in gas prices and called for a boycott of Exxon.
Yost said he would make a decision on the plan within the week.
Exxon called the boycott unjust.
