Dutch scientists have examined a clay tablet found in the ruins of Ugarit, an ancient in Syria, and have concluded that the solar eclipses recorded thereon occurred in 1223 B.C.
The tablet's text apparently indicated that Mars was visible when the eclipse occurred, and the scientists say that means the 1223 date is correct.
The tablet was found twenty years ago and at that time experts had misread the text and set the occurrence of the eclipse in 1375 B.C.
The tablet would still be the oldest known reliable account of a total solar eclipse.
