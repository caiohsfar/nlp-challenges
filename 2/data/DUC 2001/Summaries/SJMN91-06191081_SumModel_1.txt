The American Civil Liberties Union called for Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates to resign after the March 3 incident in which white police officers repeatedly struck Rodney King with batons, kicked him and shocked him with a stun gun after pulling him over for speeding.
A bystander's videotape of the beating prompted a federal investigation of police brutality.
Mayor Tom Bradley also asked Gates to step down.
But Gates was appointed by the Police Commission and cannot be fired by the mayor.
A panel that investigated the Police Department after the beating of King decided not to seek Chief Gates' resignation and neither blamed or cleared him.
