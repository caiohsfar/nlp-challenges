Hurricane Gilbert, barreling toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, has 75 mph winds and a record 26.13 barometric pressure.
With tropical storm force winds extending 250 miles north and 200 miles south, it is twice the size of last month's Debby, barely reaching 74 mph.
Other Category 5 storms were the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, with winds above 150 mph and a low pressure of 26.35; and 1969's Camille with 172 mph winds and a 25-foot high storm surge, leaving $1.4 billion in damage.
Gilbert's surge is forecast as 8-12 feet.
A Sept. 8th, 1900 hurricane hit Galveston and killed over 6,000, the worst US natural disaster.
