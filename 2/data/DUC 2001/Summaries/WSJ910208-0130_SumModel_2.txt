The Wall Street Journal received four letters on gun control in response to an op-ed article.
A life member of the NRA endorsed the Brady Bill waiting period and criticized the NRA's work against it.
Three others argued: that criminals don't care about gun-control laws and having a gun for self-protection reduces the serious effects of crime; that the op-ed piece showed the real objective of the waiting period is to eliminate handguns from our society while it's the society, not the guns that are at fault; and that the individual right to keep and bear arms is our ultimate defense against tyranny.
