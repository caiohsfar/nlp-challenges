Two propositions on California's November 6 ballot would limit the terms of statewide officeholders.
The LA Times questioned six legislators and legislative specialists about the effect in the state and nationally if either or both passed.
One legislator and one specialist would view passage as positive.
It would give people more control over the Legislature, limit the influence of special interests, prevent the creation of a career political elite and help the parties.
The other legislator and three specialists would see term limits as a negative.
It would cede power to the executive branch, to bureaucrats and lobbyists, and would foster amateurish incompetence.
