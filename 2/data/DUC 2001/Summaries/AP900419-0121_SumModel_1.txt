A sinus infection caused Elizabeth Taylor to be hospitalized on 9 April.
She was admitted to the Daniel Freeman Marine Hospital in Santa Monica, but yesterday she was transferred to St. John's Hospital and Health Center because of a persistent fever and pneumonia.
She is being treated intravenously with antibiotics.
Calls to the hospital are being referred to the New York City firm that handles Ms. Taylor's public relations.
A spokeswoman there said only that Taylor's condition had stabilized.
The actress said that she had been advised to remain in the hospital, and that she expected a full recovery.
