In a letter from Lord Bauer, House of Lords, Westminster SW1, Lord Bauer expressed his concerns that the international community may be encouraging Third World countries to default on debts.
Lord Bauer writes "The debts of African countries have often been canceled or rescheduled, frequently several times for the same country."
In expressing his views on some causes of poverty he writes "To harp on alleged external causes of Third World poverty diverts attention from the real factors behind this poverty which are domestic, and thereby from the possibilities of addressing these."
He suggests that some causes may include government dependence on precarious subsistence production.
