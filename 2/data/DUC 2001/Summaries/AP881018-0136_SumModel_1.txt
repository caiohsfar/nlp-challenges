Hurricane Joan's winds slowly grew to 80 mph as it skimmed Colombia's coast on an unusual southern path.
Originally expected to weaken, it reached hurricane force Monday night.
In Colombia it left 50 dead or missing and triggered flooding.
At noon today its center was 70 miles offshore, 380 miles east of the Island of San Andres, moving at 10 mph and kept on course by a strong high-pressure system over the northern Caribbean.
Last month Hurricane Gilbert left more than 300 dead and caused billions of dollars damage as it tore through Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, and the Yucatan peninsula.
