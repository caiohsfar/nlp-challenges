The Shining Path Central Committee, made up of members who have not been arrested as well as alternative members elected by the Shining Path congress in 1988, decided in February to continue the "people's war."
The committee also considered whether those members who uphold the peace accord with the government be removed from the party "by their own free will."
The document criticizes the leaders under arrest who try to convince the militants still operating to end the hostilities against the Peruvian government.
The Central Committee started a new phase of the "people's war" and planed an operation to rescue imprisoned leader Abimael Guzman Reinoso, dead or alive.
