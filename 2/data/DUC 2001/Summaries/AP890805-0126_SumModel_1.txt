Lightening has set the West ablaze this summer.
Hundreds of fires burned fitfully in the Idaho backcountry for days after the last "lightning bust."
One storm laid down 2,000 strikes an hour with little rain.
According to Reeve Jarvis of the Boise Interagency Fire Center some of the worst blazes can be seen from their windows.
Some of the Worst fires burn within 150 miles of the command post.
After five dry summers, backcountry timber has a moisture content only slightly higher than kiln-dried lumber.
It will take fall rains and winter snow to douse many of the nation's fires.
