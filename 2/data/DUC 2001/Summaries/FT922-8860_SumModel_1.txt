The World Bank will link loan volume to the strength of a country's efforts to fight poverty according to an operational directive issued by Mr. Lewis Preston, the bank's president.
The link between loans and poverty relief forms part of a new drive to make poverty alleviation the bank's central mission in the 1990's.
This new commitment to make comprehensive assessments of the nature and extent of poverty in the third world is a priority for the bank's effort to design more effective policies to fight poverty.
The bank says poverty assessments should be available for most developing countries within two years.
