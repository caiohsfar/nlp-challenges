At the opening session of the 42nd General Assembly Monday, Third World countries led by Brazil blamed industrialized nations in part for perpetuating their poverty.
Foreign Minister Roberto de Abreau Sodre of Brazil said that the Third World economic picture was dimming "due to the lack of progress in international economic relations."
A similar theme sounded Monday in West Berlin, where finance ministers of 22 developed or developing countries demanded "more forceful action" to help Third World countries repay $1.2 trillion in debts.
Foreign Affairs Secretary Obed Asamoah of Ghana asked creditors to write off some debts.
Ghana has an estimated foreign debt of $2.8 billion.
