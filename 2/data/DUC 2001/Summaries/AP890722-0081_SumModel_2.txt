The Maine constitution used to guarantee the right to keep and bear arms "for the common defense."
In 1986 the Maine Supreme Court upheld a gun violation by focusing on the "common defense" phrase.
The legislature, in response, enacted a constitutional amendment deleting that language declaring "Every citizen has a right to keep and bear arms, and this right shall never be questioned."
The amendment was approved by voters in November 1987.
Now a county superior court justice has ruled that even a convicted felon may own guns based on the amendment's all-inclusive language.
The Maine Attorney General has announced that he will appeal the decision.
