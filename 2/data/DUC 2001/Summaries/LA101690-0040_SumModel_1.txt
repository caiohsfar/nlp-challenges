The World Health Organization (WHO) claims tuberculosis (TB) is the world's deadliest infectious disease, annually killing nearly 3 million people worldwide, most between the ages of 15 and 59.
WHO attributed the rise to the AIDS epidemic, with 3 million people dually infected.
WHO expects between 15 and 20 million infected with AIDS by 2000, resulting in a sharp rise in TB, a highly communicable disease.
In the U.S., the number of active TB cases is up nearly 5% over the last year.
The 6-month treatment to combat the disease costs $30 to $50 per person and is not readily available in developing countries.
