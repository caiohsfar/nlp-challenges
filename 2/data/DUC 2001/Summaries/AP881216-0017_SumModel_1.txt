A panel, assembled last September after the worst fire season ever in Yellowstone National Park, recommended a temporary halt to the government's "let it burn" forest fire policy.
The panel's recommendation, made to the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior, stipulates that no fires be allowed to burn freely in national parks and wilderness areas until the Forest Service and National Park Service improve and strengthen their fire management plans.
These responsible agencies must use a common vocabulary to develop standards and policies, train employees in them and agree beforehand what will be done if fires move across administrative boundaries.
