The major earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay area Tuesday occurred in a region seismologists targeted as having the highest probability of a strong quake in Northern California.
The high probability is based on several factors, including length of time since the last major earthquake struck the area in 1906, said Clarence Allen, professor of Geology and Geophysics at the California Institute of Technology.
According to the U.S. Geological Survey's Earthquake Center, there is a higher probability of a major quake in the central California town of Parkfield, where there is a 90 percent probability of a magnitude 6 earthquake by the year 2018.
