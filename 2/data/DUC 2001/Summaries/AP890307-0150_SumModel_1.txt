A partial solar eclipse on Tuesday was visible across western North America.
It was visible to some extent, but barely so, in locations from Mazatlan, Mexico to Chicago.
Eighty percent of the sun was eclipsed in Anchorage, Alaska at 9 A.M. Those viewing the eclipse through telescopes at CALTECH in Pasadena were able to see gas jets on the sun's surface, and a giant group of sunspots.
Total solar eclipses are visible from any single location on the earth's surface roughly once every 400 years, though they are seen at least once every two years from somewhere on the earth.
