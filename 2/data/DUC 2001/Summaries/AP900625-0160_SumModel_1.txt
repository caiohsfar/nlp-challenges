The republic of Slovenia plans to draft a constitution giving it full sovereignty within a new Yugoslav federation.
Slovenia is the most politically liberal and prosperous of the country's six republics.
The proposal will be discussed by Slovenia's parliament in mid-July and approval is almost certain.
According to a recent poll 70% of Slovenes surveyed believe they would be better off outside the Yugoslav federation while only 15% desired to remain a republic within Yugoslavia in its present form.
Both Slovenia and Croatia, the two republics that held free elections this year, have proposed a loose confederation to replace the present federation.
