The Agriculture Department has been monitoring the drought situation, setting up hotlines for worried callers and issuing informational statements called the "USDA Backgrounder" listing the department's "drought-related actions".
A reporter pointed out that only two action items involved money expenditure, meat purchases for school cafeterias and credit for Mexico to buy meat.
The purchases will help livestock markets now depressed by drought-induced liquidation of herds.
The other significant action is government permission for affected farmers to harvest hay or allow cattle to graze on government set aside reserve or conservation lands.
The "Backgrounders" will be updated every two weeks.
