Although three presidential candidates have been assassinated, Colombia's government refused Friday to put off next month's election.
The Medellin drug cartel has denied responsibility for the assassination Friday of Carlos Pizarro, formerly of the M-19 rebel group.
Government officials had said that Pizarro could have helped mediate peace agreements with other leftist insurgents.
Last month the candidate of the leftist Patriotic Union Party, Bernardo Jaramillo, was killed and last August a candidate of the ruling Liberal Party, Carlos Galan, was assassinated.
Governing party candidate Cesar Gaviria, the presidential front-runner, suspended campaign activities after Pizarro's death.
