Hurricane season officially begins June 1st.
Its most active period usually begins Aug. 1st.
In the last 40 years there have been an average of six hurricanes per year.
Drought in West Africa was responsible for a drop in Atlantic hurricanes in the 1970s and 1980s.
The drought robbed storm systems of moisture needed to start their escalation into hurricanes.
In five of the last six hurricane seasons there have been just two to five hurricanes each year, except for the seven in 1985.
There were five hurricanes in 1984, four in 1986, and three in 1987.
