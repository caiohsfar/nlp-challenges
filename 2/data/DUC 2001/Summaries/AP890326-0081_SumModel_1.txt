The Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound near Valdez, the southern end of the Alaska pipeline, has been declared a disaster area.
The toll on the waterway's abundant wildlife is mounting and oil is spread over an area of about 100 miles.
The Exxon Co. said the captain was not on the bridge when the accident occurred and the third mate, who did not have a proper pilot's license, was in command.
It is believed this action violated federal regulations.
The captain, third mate, and a helmsman were relieved of duty and subpoenaed by the National Transportation Safety Board.
