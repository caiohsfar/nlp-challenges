In the California Congressional district of Rep. Bob Matsui, a leading congressional proponent of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), labor leaders, environmentalists and Perot supporters have signed a Declaration of War against NAFTA.
Working with a shoestring budget, the foes of NAFTA have worked for three years to win over the American public while proponents, mainly the business community, are spending millions to win over Congress.
The opponents believe their public efforts have turned around several congressmen.
With the conclusion this week of talks over side agreements, both sides are prepared to go all out in their respective lobbying efforts.
