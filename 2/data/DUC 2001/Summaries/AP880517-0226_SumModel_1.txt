A single-engined Cessna plane crashed on 17 May 1988 on the outskirts of Albuquerque, killing all five people on board.
The plane from Salt Lake City, was attempting to land at Coronado Airport in light rain and gusty winds.
An eye witness, a 17-year-old student pilot, said that the pilot was attempting to achieve level flight in gusty winds.
The plane went nose-in to the ground and flipped over.
The witness said that there was fuel everywhere and fear of a fire.
NTSB and FAA authorities were en route to the site to conduct an investigation.
