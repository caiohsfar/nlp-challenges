Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates has been accused of nurturing one of the most brutal police forces in the country.
In his 14 years of office, his critics say he has built a police force in his own image: aggressive, insensitive and widely tinged with racism.
In 1978, Mr. Gates told a Hispanic audience that Hispanic officers were not promoted because they were lazy and that the often fatal choke hold used by police might be more dangerous for blacks because their arteries did not open up as fast as on "normal" people.
Following numerous calls for his resignation, Mr. Gates has decided to step down in June.
