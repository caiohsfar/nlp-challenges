Pinpoint, Georgia, the home town of Clarence Thomas, made no secret of its pride in its favorite son.
Its citizens, including his mother, Leola Williams, were anxiously awaiting the results of the U.S. Senate vote on 16 October 1991 for U.S. Supreme Court justice.
When the confirmation came, it brought joyful and prayerful exclamations from his mother and the townspeople.
A reporter asked about the sexual harrassment charge brought against her son by Anita Hill in 1981-1983.
His mother responded with a prayer and the comment that Hill was "put up to it" by someone else.
