On July 1, 1991 President Bush nominated Clarence Thomas, a black conservative republican, to replace Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court.
Thomas is a bootstrap conservative who does not believe in affirmative action, quotas or racial preferences for minority groups, saying that these are unconstitutional.
Thomas studied for the priesthood at one time.
He has never taken a stand on abortion, which Catholicism opposes.
Abortion rights proponents intend to oppose him.
His stand on the major issues is largely unknown.
President Bush believes that Thomas is a self- made success.
If confirmed, he could be on the Supreme Court by October, 1991.
