Allegations of police racism and brutality have shaken Minneapolis following the deaths of two blacks at a drug raid that went awry.
Another incident 10-days later involved a scuffle between police and blacks at a downtown hotel.
In the first incident, Lloyd Smalley, 71 and Lillian Weiss, 65 were killed Jan. 25 in a fire that started after police hurled a stun grenade into their apartment, where others also lived.
In the hotel scuffle, police said they responded to a call of a loud party.
Partygoers alleged that officers used the term "nigger," and beat some of them severely enough to require them to seek medical attention.
