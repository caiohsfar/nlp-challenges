Yesterday, Hurricane Andrew, after smashing its way through Louisiana, was downgraded to a tropical storm, in that its sustained wind speeds were below 75 mph.
The storm narrowly missed the city of New Orleans and caused little damage to Louisiana's oil industry.
Damage, estimated at more than $15 billion, was mostly to uninsured property in Florida and occurred in a 10-mile wide band 25 miles south of Miami.
Insurer's losses are believed to be less than $1 billion.
Hurricane Hugo, which devastated much of South Carolina in 1989 causing an estimated $6-10 billion in damage, cost the insurance industry some $4.2 billion.
