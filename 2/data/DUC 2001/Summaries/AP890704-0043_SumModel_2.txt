Col. Herminio Taylo, 54, police chief of Makati, Philippines was assassinated today.
The assassins identified themselves as members of the New People's Army, the same group that claimed responsibility for the April 21 assassination of Col. Rowe of the Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group.
Taylo was the tenth soldier or policeman slain in the Manilla area in the last two weeks.
President Corazon Aquino, whose husband Benigno was assassinated in 1983, expressed her sympathy for the family of Col. Taylo.
National Security Adviser Rafael Ileto said the killing showed that every soldier and policeman was a potential target of assassination.
