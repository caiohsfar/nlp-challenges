American insurers today face huge losses as Hurricane Andrew heads across the Gulf of Mexico after slamming directly into Miami where it did massive damage.
Furthermore, there could be severe flooding if it hits low lying New Orleans, or extensive damage to oil industry facilities along the coast or offshore in the Gulf.
A United Kingdom adjuster estimates that losses could reach $15 billion.
This compares with $4 billion for Hugo, the last major Hurricane to hit the U.S.
The brunt of losses will be with US insurers because they have in recent years placed fewer of their risks with Lloyd's of London.
