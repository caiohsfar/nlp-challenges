A death squad opposed to the Shining Path guerrillas has threatened to kill a district attorney if he investigates charges that soldiers massacred dozens of peasants, his office said Tuesday.
The Rodrigo Franco Command, which has vowed to kill a Shining Path member or sympathizer for every person slain by guerrillas, issued the threat against District Attorney Carlos Escobar on Monday, according to his office in Ayacucho.
Escobar is investigating charges that troops rounded up dozens of peasants, accused them of being Shining Path members and killed them.
The alleged massacre occurred in May near Cayara, a farming village 40 miles south of Ayacucho.
