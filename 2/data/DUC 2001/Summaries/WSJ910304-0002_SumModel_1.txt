The incidence of active tuberculosis cases in New York City rose 38% in 1990.
The city Health Department claims an aggressive attack on this epidemic.
The Department is testing and treating the homeless, has established a residence for homeless victims, requires testing of all children entering school, and is training staffs at homeless and substance abuse treatment centers in TB prevention and control.
The TB bacteria is estimated to infect 1,000,000 New Yorkers, but 99% do not have an active case.
Those with a high risk are people with defenses weakened by HIV infection, other serious illnesses, or poor nutrition.
