Two US Air Force F-16 fighter jets on a training mission crashed and exploded today near Bodenheim, Germany, less than two hours after another F-16 crashed into the Black Forest.
One pilot was killed in the crash.
The other ejected safely.
Both aircraft were assigned to the 50th Tactical Fighter Wing at Hahn Air Base.
The planes crashed near a populated area.
Fortunately, no one on the ground was injured.
The earlier crash was a plane from the 52nd Tactical Fighter Wing at Spanghahlen Air Base.
That pilot ejected safely.
West German police and military police have secured both crash sites.
