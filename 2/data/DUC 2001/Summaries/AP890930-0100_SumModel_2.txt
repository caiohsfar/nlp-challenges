In Chicago two days of racially charged hearing on police brutality and a report detailing widespread segregation in the nation's third-largest city show the new mayor must still heal some old wounds.
Richard M. Daley was elected mayor April 4 and is already faced with complaints of police brutality.
Some black politicians say the mayor is indirectly sanctioning racism by not doing enough to stop it.
The City Council called two days of special hearings last week where blacks alleged they were the victims of police brutality accused officers, most of them white, of unprovoked beatings, false arrests, intimidation and insulting them with racial slurs.
