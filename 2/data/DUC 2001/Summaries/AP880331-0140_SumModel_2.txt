Changing spring weather in the U.S. often brings with it the violence of tornadoes.
In 1988 there were fewer than normal deaths but there were over 700 tornadoes.
Weather officials believe that public preparedness is responsible for the fewer deaths.
The number of tornadoes peaks in May.
They usually occur between noon and sunset.
Hot weather helps to form thunderstorms and their accompanying tornadoes.
The weather services advise: a. Turn on radios and televisions for tornado information.
b. Go to the basement of a house or building, staying away from windows and outside walls.

If in a car or trailer, leave immediately.
