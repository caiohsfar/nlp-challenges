After drilling and digging since 1987 from their respective ends of the "chunnel", the British and French were able to talk directly through a small hole created when British workers sent a probe through the barrier separating them from their French counterparts It was a tiny hole, but it marked the end of Britain's island status.
The breakthrough came in the service tunnel.
That tunnel should be finished in January.
The first coupling of the two rail tunnels is expected in mid-1991.
The rails will then be laid and all work should be completed in June 1993.
