New cases of mad cow disease", or BSE, are still being reported at a rate of about 1000 per week.
Last month a second dairy farmer, Mr. Duncan Templeman, succumbed to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a human brain ailment similar to BSE.
The new cases and the deaths of two dairy farmers have prompted a new wave of public criticism of the government officials who stoutly maintain that there is no evidence that BSE contributed to the deaths.
The government still insists that scrapie-contaminated feed is the cause of the reported cases of BSE.
