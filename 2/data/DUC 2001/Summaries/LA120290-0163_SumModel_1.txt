The British and French tunnelers had made contact on October 29 when a two-inch hole had been driven through the chalk barrier separating them, but it was last Saturday before the passage was big enough to allow them to walk through and shake hands.

The "chunnel" is viewed positively in France, but the English worry about the loss of their protective moat.
