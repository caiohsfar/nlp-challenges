A coalition of members of Congress plans to sue the Census Bureau to prevent it from including illegal immigrants in its 1990 census count.
The suit to be filed by some 40 members of Congress and the Federation for American Immigration Reform contends that including 2 million or more illegal aliens in the count would cause unfair shifts of seats from one state to another when reapportionment takes place.
Census officials counter that the U.S. Constitution calls for apportionment to be based on the "whole number of persons" residing in the various states and makes no mention of citizenship in this regard.
