Robert A. Goldwin says the Second Amendment provides a solid constitutional basis for national gun-control legislation.
Analyzing debates in the First Congress, he educes the intended meaning of "the right to bear arms" to be the right to serve in the militia, a provision intended to keep Congress from establishing a standing army, and instead to rely on state militias.
Under the Militia Act of 1792 "every free able-bodied white male citizen" was required to enroll in the militia and provide his own firearms.
"In plain 1990's English, if you want to own a gun, sign up with the National Guard."
