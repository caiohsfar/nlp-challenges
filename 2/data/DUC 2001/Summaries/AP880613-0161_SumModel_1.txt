Police captured the top military leader of the Shining Path, the Maoist rebel group whose eight-year guerrilla war has taken more than 10,000 lives in Peru, officials said.
Police captured Osman Morote, 43, considered the most radical leader of the movement.
Police said Morote was arrested before dawn Sunday at a house in downtown Lima along with two women.
"Morote is considered the No. 2 of the party and its military chief," the independent magazine Si said recently.
The Shining Path is seeking to overthrow Peru's elected government and install a peasant and worker state patterned after the ideas of Mao Tse-tung.
