Nelson W. Polsby, Director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at UC Berkeley, believes that constitutional changes to limit the terms of elected federal and state officials won't accomplish their purported goals.
They will not decrease the influence and money of interest groups.
To the contrary, veteran legislators can better handle these groups than can novices.
Limitations won't improve the functioning of the legislature.
It takes time for legislators to learn their jobs.
And limitations won't enhance representative democracy.
It guarantees that good legislators will disappear along with the bad.
It arbitrarily prevents voters from returning to office those legislators they favor.
