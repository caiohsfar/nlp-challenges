President Clinton has chosen William Daley, younger brother of Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, to head the task force assigned to get the North American Free Trade Act (NAFTA) through Congress.
Daley is a smooth-talking behind the scenes operator with long-standing ties with organized labor.
Polls show that two-thirds of the American people do not support NAFTA and grassroots opposition led by labor groups is growing.
Many Democrats in Congress including some from Illinois are uncommitted and it is Daley's job to convince moderate Democrats to back the agreement.
He must marshal 73 votes from Democratic representatives of states standing to gain the most from NAFTA.
