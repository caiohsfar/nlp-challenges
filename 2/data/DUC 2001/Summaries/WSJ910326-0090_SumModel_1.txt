13,000 runners expect to compete in the Boston Marathon on April 15th.
The course is a jagged 26 miles and 385 yards from Hopkinton, MA, to downtown Boston.
Five miles into the race, a runner can waste energy charging up a set of little hills.
A steep descent into Newton Lower Falls can jar runners' bones.
After a long column of trees comes Heartbreak Hill, and finally the Haunted Mile, a stretch where many runners have collapsed.
The race is covered by TV from start to finish and offers a total of $402,000 in prize money.
Winners get a medal and $55,000.
