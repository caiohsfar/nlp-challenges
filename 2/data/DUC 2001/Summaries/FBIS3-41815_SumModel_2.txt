The London zoo's small herd of kudu has been hit by a strain of the "mad cow disease".
Five of the eight kudu born at the zoo since 1987 have contracted the disease.
Only one of the five could have eaten feed that contained sheep protein.
Such contaminated food has been identified as the source of the disease in cattle.
The disease has also been found in domestic cats, and in the larger cheetah and puma.
Scientists at the zoo feel the outbreak in the kudu herd shows some species are more vulnerable than others.
