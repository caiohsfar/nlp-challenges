A police officer that had been cleared by the internal affairs office in Santa Clara of any wrong doing in a brutality case was later arrested and prosecuted by the district attorney.
The offending officer's police report indicated that the suspect's injuries were due to a fall from his bike and that he appeared unconscious, although he had also struggled against being handcuffed.
But four citizens called to complain that they had witnessed the arrest and that the suspect at no time resisted arrest.
Witnesses said the officer taunted the suspect, knelt on his stomach, beat him numerous times with his club and kicked him in his face.
