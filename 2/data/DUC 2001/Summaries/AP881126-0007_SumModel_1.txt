Further study of a newly isolated hormone found in the pancreases of diabetics may lead to new treatments for the most common form of the disease.
Garth Cooper, a New Zealand biochemist who has been working with scientists at Oxford University, said the hormone, amylin, is normally undetectable but is found in high levels in the pancreases of diabetics.
Amylin appears to be responsible for the obesity, reduced insulin secretion and the reduced effectiveness of insulin observed in Type II diabetes.
Type II diabetes afflicts the majority of America's 11 million diabetics.
Researchers hope to develop substances that block amylin's secretion or action.
