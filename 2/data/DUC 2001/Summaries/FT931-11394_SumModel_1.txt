President Clinton will form a task force shortly that will reform welfare programs.
His reform includes expanded job training for the unemployed and a requirement that people work for their welfare checks.
Health coverage and other benefits would continue.
Welfare reformers fear that the Democratic emphasis on requiring recipients to work or enroll in training might be canceled in favor of more funding for current programs.
This would come at a time when state revenues are limited due to recession and welfare rolls have increased by 30 percent.
Many states have already begun their own welfare reform programs.
