In 1990 De Beers' London-based Central Selling Organization, CSO, signed a five billion dollar contract with the former Soviet Union.
After the USSR break-up, the contract was continued with Rosalmazzoloto, the Russian gold and diamond organization.
Most of the diamonds come from Siberia, now an autonomous republic.
Russian-Siberian friction prompted Mr. Harry Oppenheimer to schedule a visit to Russia and Siberia to insure that the De Beers grip on the diamond market is not weakened.
A trade newspaper is reporting that two Belgian trading organizations are being temporarily excluded from CSO "sights", presumably for refusing diamond at a previous "sight".
