The U.S. Senate voted Thursday to exclude illegal aliens from the 1990 census, causing an immediate and strong reaction in California.
With an estimated 50% of the nations 3-8 million illegal aliens, California could lose Congressional seats and as much as $300 million in federal aid as a result of the Senate vote unless the measure is overturned by the House of Representatives.
Critics term the action outrageous arguing that the Senate measure is probably unconstitutional and would result in fear and intimidation among recent immigrants, discouraging them from participating in the census.
