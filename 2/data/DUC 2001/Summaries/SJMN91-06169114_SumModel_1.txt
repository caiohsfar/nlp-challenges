A 1926 hurricane, almost exactly the strength of Hugo which hit South Carolina with 135 mph winds in September 1989, hit Miami when there were no high-rises.
Miami was also hit by legendary storms in 1947, 1949, and 1950.
The last hurricane to hit was a small one named Cleo in 1964.
A 1935 hurricane with 200 mph winds, the strongest to hit the continent, killed over 800 workers brought to build the Overseas Highway through the Florida Keys when their evacuation train was knocked off the tracks.
In 1900 a hurricane surprised Galveston, Texas and killed 6,000 people.
