A strong association exists between seasonal rainfall in West Africa and the formation of intense hurricanes.
Hurricanes form from strong winds sweeping across Africa and the Atlantic and gathering strength as they pick up additional moisture.
Wet Sahel periods from 1870-1900, 1915-1935 and 1947-1969 correlate with higher hurricane activity.
From 1970-1988, severe Sahel drought has correlated with low hurricane activity, except for Gloria in 1985.
Reduced hurricane activity over these two decades spurred development in areas vulnerable to hurricanes.
Intense Caribbean hurricanes Gilbert, Joan and Hugo of 1988 and 1989 may be the forerunners of increased hurricane activity in the future.
