Over the past two years, the Ventura County district attorney's office in four separate incidents has declined to prosecute suspects who contended that they were victims of police brutality while being arrested for various offenses by Oxnard officers.
A fifth man was charged with a misdemeanor.
Three of the five men have filed police brutality lawsuits against the city, the department or the police officers involved.
Assistant Police Chief William Kady declined to discuss the brutality allegations against the Oxnard officers but he said that the decision by the district attorney's office not to prosecute the suspects do not reflect poorly on the department.
