While Lt. Guy Zanti's wife and father run the 26.2 miles of today's Marine Corps Marathon in Washington, the naval officer intends to match their efforts on the battleship Wisconsin where he is stationed.
The ship had been based in the Mediterranean, so he planned on training on land and ship and then running the marathon on land.
When the Wisconsin was deployed to the gulf, Zanti continued his training and plans to run on the ship.
The Wisconsin is 887 feet long, about one-sixth of a mile, so the 29-year old Zanti will have to make about 75 laps.
