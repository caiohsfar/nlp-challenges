An Australian based company, known as Auridiam, is raising capital to further develop the River Ranch diamond mine located in Southern Zimbabwe.
De Beers mined the site after discovering diamonds in 1975, but gave up rights to it in 1991 when the Zimbabwe government insisted that all diamonds would have to be sold through the state-controlled Ministry of Mines.
Most of River Ranch's gem diamonds are small, typically under a half-carat.
The mine has yielded some larger stones.
Annual production is expected to reach 300,000 carats.
De Beers sees that figure as no threat to their marketing cartel.
