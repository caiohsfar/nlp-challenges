Sixty Forest Service firefighters brought Michigan's four-day Hiawatha National Forest fire under control after it burned 1100 acres of woodlands.
Firefighters were brought in from several states over the Fourth of July holiday to help fight the blaze.
Elsewhere, overnight rain helped limit the growth of the Shoshone National Forest fire in Wyoming that has burned 1650 acres so far.
The rain provided a reprieve to the 430 firefighters who are fighting the blaze from the air with helicopters and three air tankers and on the ground with four bulldozers.
Fires in Yosemite and Yellowstone National Parks are also being contained.
