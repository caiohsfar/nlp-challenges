Insurance companies are trying to determine their claims costs from Hurricane Andrew damage.
There are damage estimates of up to $20 billion, but most damage was not insured.
Some loss adjusters believe all claims could run as high as $8 billion, but others have placed estimates as low as $1 billion.
General Accident, the leading British insurer, estimates their claims could cost as much as $40 million.
This is the amount at which their externally purchased catastrophe reinsurance coverage is triggered, meaning, losses greater than this $40 million threshold would be paid by other reinsurance companies and not by General Accident.
