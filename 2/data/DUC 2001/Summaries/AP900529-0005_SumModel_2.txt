Hurricane Hugo last year was the worst hurricane to strike the southeast US coast since Betsy hit the Florida Keys in 1965 and killed 74 before moving to Mississippi and Louisiana.
Hugo killed 28 in the Lesser Antilles, 29 in South Carolina, and caused an unprecedented $10 billion in damage.
It heavily damaged several small sparsely populated SC communities.
Early warnings allowed 350,000 to be evacuated.
In South Carolina the worst of the storm struck the Francis Marion National Forest between Charleston and Myrtle Beach.
If Hugo had struck a major coastal population center, the destruction would have been huge.
