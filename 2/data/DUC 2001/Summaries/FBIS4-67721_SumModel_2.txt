Over the past year there has been an increase in tuberculosis morbidity and mortality in Latvia.
Morbidity increased by 14.8 percent and mortality by 44%.
The total number of infectious cases was 868, up from 771 in 1993.
The State Tuberculosis and Lung Disease Center attributed the increases to poor socioeconomic conditions and the slow legislative process.
Proposals to pass laws requiring mandatory treatment of infectious cases of TB have not been acted upon.
Latvia has 11 state tuberculosis hospitals providing free treatment, including the newest, Ceplisi, which began operations in January and primarily is treating chronic alcoholics infected with the disease.
