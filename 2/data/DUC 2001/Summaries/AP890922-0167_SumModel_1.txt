Tracking models created by supercomputers at the National Meteorological Center in Suitland, MD; satellites; and analysis by hurricane forecasters provided a good idea of the destructive path that Hurricane Hugo would follow.
Forecasters identified Hugo's landfall point in time for people to be evacuated from the South Carolina coast, although pinpointing it was difficult.
The real forecasting problem, however, was predicting the storm's intensity, because there are no reliable computer models for that.
Hugo was upgraded to Category 4 just hours before it slammed into Charleston.
Its last-minute increase in wind speed, reported by Air Force reconnaissance, surprised hurricane specialists.
