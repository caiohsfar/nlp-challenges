Everyone agrees "the right of the people" as it appears elsewhere in the Bill of Rights means a right for individual citizens.
Why in the case of the Second Amendment should it mean just a state's right to be protected from the federal government?
While the existence of an individual right to own guns doesn't mean it is absolute, still a flat ban on all handguns would be hard to justify under the constitution.
The all or nothing arguments of some gun nuts are not convincing, but it is clear that the individual right to bear arms is still there in the Constitution.
