Edward W. Crane, President, Cato Institute, argues that 75% of Americans support term limitation because they recognize it as an opportunity for citizens to wrest control of government from an impervious Congress full of professional politicians.
Incumbent legislators have carefully crafted a web of perks and privileges that make challenging them a futile crusade.
Once elected, officeholders are corrupted by the "culture of ruling" that permeates Washington.
They lose common sense and begin believing their opinion is more important than it really is.
A true "citizen Congress" would be comprised of legislators on a temporary leave-of-absence from real world work, not career politicians.
