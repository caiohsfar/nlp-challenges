Central American and Caribbean governments are anxiously awaiting a US statement on measures to cushion the economic dislocation which they expect to result from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The countries fear that a more competitive Mexico, with free access to the US and Canada, will capture markets which Caribbean basin countries have developed under current trade agreements.
The region has asked for "parity" with Mexico in exporting to NAFTA signatories.
There is yet no indication of what the US administration will propose, but an acceptance of "parity" that would amount to a de facto extension of NAFTA is unlikely.
