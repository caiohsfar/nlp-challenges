Residents of California's Bay Area were busy looking for eyeshades that would allow them to view tomorrow's eclipse in safety.
Local planetariums and observatories were deluged with requests for viewing sessions even though the Bay Area will see only a 63 percent eclipse.
The serious eclipse viewers had booked flights months, or even years ago.
Guatemala provided an example of a different manner of preparation.
There an eclipse is a cause for great and noisy celebration.
Townspeople burn incense, ring church bells and wave tools to scare away the mythical gargantuan bat they believe obscures the sun.
