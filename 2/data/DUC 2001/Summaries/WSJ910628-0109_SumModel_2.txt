Less than two days after Slovenia and Croatia unilaterally seceded from the Yugoslav federation, the federal government mobilized troops to reassert control.
The declarations of independence came after months of unsuccessful negotiations among leaders of the six republics with Serbia insisting on strong central control while Slovenia and Croatia demanded a looser confederation.
Serbia fears the fate of Serbs in an independent Croatia and the loss of economic support from Slovenia and Croatia, the federation's wealthiest republics.
With only 7 million of Yugoslavia's 23 million population the two republics supply about two-thirds of Yugoslavia's foreign exchange and half of the country's gross national product.
