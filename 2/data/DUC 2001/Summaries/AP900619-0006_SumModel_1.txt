1990 has been a disastrous year so far due to tornadoes and floods in the mid-western and southern U.S.
An above-average 726 tornadoes, some more violent than in the past, have touched down as of 19 June.
The cause is a West Coast pattern of low pressure that keeps the jet stream at a more southern latitude.
There may be some relief to this pattern soon.
Computers have helped the watch, warning and response system in keeping the death toll down.
Flooding in the South and the Plains since April has also added to the loss of life and property damage.
