There is, perhaps, hope for normalization of relations between Slovenia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), but don't hold your breath.
Although Slovenia has refused to accept Yugoslavia's offer of recognition or to recognize in return, a sign of some softening in Slovenia's attitude came in words spoken in November 1993 by the Slovenian President and the minister of foreign affairs suggesting a degree of openness to reconciliation.
On the other side the FRY minister of foreign affairs, with many reservations, has said "Yugoslavia is interested in good relations with all of its neighbors ... Slovenia is no exception."
