While federal army tanks and jets pounded Slovenia last week, the Ljubljana Stock Exchange enjoyed one of its best days ever.
But yesterday, with a tenuous peace settling over Slovenia, the exchange panicked.
The exchange's chief executive opined, "Slovenes are now beginning to see the costs of independence more clearly than when we were at war."
The fact is that no one knows where Slovenia is headed.
The shunning of Slovenian independence by Western Europe and the U.S. is particularly disillusioning to the Slovenes who have always considered themselves as Westerners.
Finding new markets in the West is critical to Slovenia's future.
