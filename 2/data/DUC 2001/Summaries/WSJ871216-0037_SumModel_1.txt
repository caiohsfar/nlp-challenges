Bank of Boston Corp.'s decision to treat its Third World loans much more conservatively is expected to have significant domestic and international repercussions.
Domestically, the move reflects the competitive advantage that regional banks with large loan-loss reserves have over their big brothers in such money centers as New York, Chicago and San Francisco.
Internationally, it appears that it will be even more difficult for economically troubled developing nations to attract new bank loans.
While large banks are eager to remain competitive with such regionals as Bank of Boston, they also want to ensure that regionals continue to lend to heavily indebted developing nations.
