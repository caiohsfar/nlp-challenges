Botswana is the world's most important producer of valuable diamonds.
De Beers has had a special relationship with Botswana since 1987 when Botswana sold its diamond stockpile to De Beers for 250 million dollars and a 5.27 percent share in the company.
The contract between Botswana and De Beers expired on December 31, 1990.
A new contract is being negotiated, and Botswana wants to sell some of its output independently.
De Beers rejects that.
Argyle Diamonds of Australia is also negotiating a new contract with De Beers.
Australia ranks first in volume of diamonds produced, but only sixth in terms of value.
