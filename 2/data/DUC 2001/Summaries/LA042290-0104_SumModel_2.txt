Ten thousand cattle have been killed in Britain in an attempt to limit the spread of the "mad cow disease".
Experts suspect that the disease is spread through cattle feed that contains sheep by-products that are used as protein supplement.
In June 1988 the government banned the use of sheep offal in cattle feed, but new cases of the disease are still being reported.
The government contends that the disease poses no threat to humans.
The United States and several other countries have banned the importation of British beef.
