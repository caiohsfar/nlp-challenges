Iben Browning, a climatologist, predicted that an earthquake would occur along the New Madrid Fault on Monday.
Schools were closed and residents purchased earthquake emergency kits and others left town but it was just another normal day.
Browning said there was a 50-50 chance for a major earthquake early, this week along the fault, which stretches from Marked Tree, Ark., northeast through New Marid, Mo., to Cairo, Ill.
He believes tidal forces can trigger earthquakes, a theory most scientists reject.
"There's just no way to predict an earthquake precisely," said Waverly Person, chief of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center.
"There are no two earthquakes alike."
