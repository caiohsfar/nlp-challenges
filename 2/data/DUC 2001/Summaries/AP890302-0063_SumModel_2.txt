The number of tuberculosis (TB) cases among HIV positive patients, especially drug addicts, has been growing in recent years.
People with the tuberculosis bacteria ordinarily have only about a 10 per cent risk of getting active TB; however, HIV, the AIDS virus, weakens the body's defenses against other diseases and lowers resistance to the tuberculosis bacteria.
A recent study conducted on 520 drug users in a methadone program found, during an almost 2-year follow-up, that eight AIDS-infected people developed active tuberculosis while no tuberculosis occurred in those who were non- HIV.
Administering the drug isoniazid prevented tuberculosis development and is now administered along with the methadone.
