Investors believe the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will be good for the US economy.
The superior products and industrial productivity rates of the US will give it the greatest economic benefits.
But rejection of NAFTA might lead to more protectionism, higher inflation and slower world economic growth.
Anti-NAFTA forces fear that opening up trade with Mexico will lead to a migration of American jobs south to Mexico's lower wages.
Al Gore clearly bested Ross Perot in the debate on Tuesday apparently winning over more Americans to NAFTA, but it is clear that the vote Wednesday in Congress will be close.
