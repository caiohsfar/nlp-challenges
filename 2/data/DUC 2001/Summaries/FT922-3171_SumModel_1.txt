Just weeks ago the prospects for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) seemed assured.
It was supported by the Republican establishment, the prospective Democratic presidential nominee, and much of the Democratic Congressional leadership.
Now the picture is clouded.
Candidate Perot stresses that NAFTA would send jobs to Mexico.
It is too late to get congressional approval of NAFTA this year and after the elections the makeup of the House could change, leaving the sentiment there on trade in doubt.
The environment/farm/labor coalition now has 200 signatories in the house to a resolution conditioning approval of NAFTA on strong environment and food safety provisions.
