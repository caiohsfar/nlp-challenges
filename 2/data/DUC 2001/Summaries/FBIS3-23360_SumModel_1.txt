Lebanese and Jordanian authorities have unraveled the mystery surrounding the assassination of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al- Ma'ayitah in Beirut on 29 January.
It appears that the Abu-Nidal group, the prime suspects in the assassination, was not acting alone.
There was close coordination between the Fatah-- the Revolutionary Council (FRC) of the Abu-Nidal group and Jordanian fundamentalist extremist groups sponsored by Iran, specifically the Jordanian fundamentalist Islamic Mobilization Youth Organization (IMYO) which is financed by Iran.
The assassins received training at an Abu-Nidal center in Lebanon from a Palestinian expert in assassinations who was implicated in the assassination of FRC official Bahij Abu-al-Hana in July 19 92.
