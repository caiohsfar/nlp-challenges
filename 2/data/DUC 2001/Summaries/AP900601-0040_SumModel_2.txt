1988's Hurricane Gilbert and last year's Hugo both reached Category 5, meaning top winds greater than 155 mph.
Gilbert killed over 300 and caused heavy damage from the Lesser Antilles to Mexico.
Hugo killed 28 in the Caribbean and 29 in South Carolina and caused a record $10 billion in damage.
Between 1940 and 1969, 22 hurricanes with 110 mph winds hit the US, but due to drought in Africa's Sahel, from 1970 to 1989 only eight did.
Hugo revealed inadequacies in the Emergency Broadcast System and some emergency shelters.
In the Caribbean, Gilbert cut communications links, causing officials to improve systems.
