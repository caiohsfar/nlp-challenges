A B-52 bomber, while practicing "touch-and-go landings", crashed and burst into flames at 1:15 a.m. today at K.I. Sawyer AFB, Michigan.
The plane, normally equipped to carry nuclear bombs, had no weapons aboard.
The eight crewmembers, suffering broken bones but no burns, were taken to area hospitals.
Their conditions range from critical to satisfactory.
The B-52 is the military's biggest bomber.
The last one was commissioned in 1962.
The Air Force has recently had more trouble with the B-52's successor aircraft, the B-1B.
Four have crashed in the four years the plane has been flying, including two crashes nine days apart in November.
