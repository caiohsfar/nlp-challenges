In a blow to California and other states with large immigrant populations, the Senate voted Friday to bar the Census Bureau from counting illegal aliens in the 1990 census.
Since the House has already rejected such a proposal, administration officials, who argued that the measure is both unconstitutional and unworkable, hope that it is dropped after referral to a Senate-House conference.
Minority leader Dole (R-Kan.)
complained that "Some states will lose congressional seats because of illegal aliens."
Sen. Wilson (R-Calif.)
countered that excluding illegal residents is unfair to states that have suffered from a huge influx of immigration.
