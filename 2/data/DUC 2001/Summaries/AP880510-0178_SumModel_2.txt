Yasser Arafat Tuesday accused the United States of threatening to kill PLO officials if Palestinian guerillas attack American targets.
Denying the accusation, the State Department explained that it had received reports that the PLO might target Americans because of alleged U.S. involvement in the assassination of Khalil Wazir (code name Abu Jihad), the PLO's second in command.
(Wazir was killed April 16 during a raid on his house near Tunis, Tunisia.)
Arafat took U.S. denial of any involvement in the assassination and warning that the PLO would be held accountable for any action against U.S. personnel to be a threat to assassinate PLO leaders.
