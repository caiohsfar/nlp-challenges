Hurricane Gilbert, sprawled across the western Caribbean, gained hurricane-force winds over the weekend and became a Category 5 storm Tuesday afternoon with winds of 160 mph and central pressure of 26.66 inches.
It should reach the Gulf of Mexico by Thursday.
It is one of the Great Hurricanes as far as intensity, size and destructive potential.
Category 5 storms making landfall this century have been the 1935 hurricane that struck the Florida Keys and killed 600; and 1969's Hurricane Camille, which devastated the Mississippi coast, killing 256.
The last major hurricane to make landfall was Elena in 1985 along the Mississippi, Alabama and Florida Panhandle.
