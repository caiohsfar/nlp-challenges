The barometric pressure at Hurricane Gilbert's center plummeted to 26.13 inches at 5:58pm Tuesday night, making it the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere from that standpoint.
Gilbert gained hurricane-force winds last weekend and by Tuesday night became a Category 5 storm with winds of 175 mph.
The two other Category 5 storms to hit land this century were the Labor Day hurricane of 1935, which struck the Florida Keys and killed 408; and 1969's Hurricane Camille, which devastated the Mississippi coast, killing 256.
The last major hurricane to make landfall was Elena in 1985 along the Mississippi, Alabama and Florida Panhandle.
