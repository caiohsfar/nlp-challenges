Less than a month before elections, a third presidential candidate in Colombia has been assassinated.
A gunman on a suicide mission shot Carlos Pizarro, candidate of the leftist April 19 Movement, or M-10, on a jetliner Thursday.
Sen. Luis Carlos Galan of the ruling Liberal Party was assassinated in Bogota last August and Bernardo Jaramillo of the leftist Patriotic Union Party was killed last month at the Bogota airport.
Authorities have blamed the assassinations on drug traffickers.
Official investigations have shown that some members of the Colombian armed forces are allied with drug traffickers and right-wing death squads.
