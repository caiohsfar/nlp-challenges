Fires burn thousands of acres in seven western states, at times threatening homes, as firefighters contend with wind and high temperatures.
The Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho listed 7,000 to 7,500 people fighting fires throughout the U.S., along with 42 air tankers, 14 guide planes and 10 helicopters.
So far this year, the agency has reported 31,000 fires, which have burned 1,117,000 acres.
In the same period last year, it had 54,000 fires which burned 765,000 acres.
To date, the largest fire in the lower 48 states is the Diamond Peak Utah fire, which burned 12,200 acres.
