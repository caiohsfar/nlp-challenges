Slovenia's economic prospects would improve if it could gain access to $1.6 billion in foreign exchange deposits from Slovene banks which have been frozen in the former National Bank of Yugoslavia since independence.
Resolution of this problem depends on relations with Yugoslavia which are not good.
Slovenia is also anxious to settle its share (estimated at $1.8 billion) of the unallocated Yugoslav federal debt totaling $14.6 billion.
Slovene economists are hopeful that the European Community-sponsored peace conference on Yugoslavia might resolve issues related to the debt and that the US might recognize Slovenia thus speeding admission to the IMF and other financial institutions.
