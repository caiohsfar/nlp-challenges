Mr. Lewis Preston, World Bank President, yesterday promised to strengthen the bank's efforts to reduce poverty in developing countries.
However, he failed to respond to demands from the Clinton administration for the bank to set more precise targets for the proportion of lending that should have an explicit poverty focus.
In fiscal 1992, nearly half of all World Bank adjustment loans failed to include specific poverty reduction measures, in spite of a call from Mr. Preston to put greater emphasis on poverty relief.
The share of bank lending allocated for "human resource development" is still only 14 percent.
