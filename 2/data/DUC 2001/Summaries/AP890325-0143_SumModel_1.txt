Some 10,080,000 gallons of crude oil spilled early Friday when the tanker Exxon Valdez ran against a reef 25 miles outside Valdez, Alaska.
One authority called it a major environmental catastrophe, noting that the only way for the oil to escape out to sea was to traverse the entire length of Prince William Sound thereby contaminating the shoreline.
Other authorities criticized the slow response to the spill and noted the danger to wildlife, especially a key herring spawning area.
The ship struck the reef while maneuvering to avoid icebergs.
The vessel's captain,i Joseph Hazelwood, has worked for Exxon for 20 years.
