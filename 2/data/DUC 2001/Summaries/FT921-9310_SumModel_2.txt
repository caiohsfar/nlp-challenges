The condition known in cattle as "mad cow disease", spongiform encephalopathy, has shown up in Britain's sparsely scattered antelope population.
Over the past three years the disease has been diagnosed in three elands, three kudu and an Arabian oryx.
Since 1989 the condition has also shown up in 34 cats and 29 goats.
Only 348 cases of sheep encephalopathy, or scrapie, were reported in 1990, as contrasted with 894 cases in 1991.
Since 1992 the British government has been encouraging the reporting of scrapie to aid in the spongiform encephalopathy research.
