Independence gave Slovenia the opportunity to build an open market economy and democratic institutions, but it has had its costs.
Slovenian enterprises relied on exports to the rest of Europe based on sales in Yugoslavia.
The UN embargo on trade with Serbia meant the loss of Slovenia's largest market and an end to cheap Serbian raw materials.
Now Slovenia must lower real wages and increase productivity to compensate.
Continuing warfare in the rest of the former Yugoslavia has wiped out a profitable transient tourist industry.
But the new coalition government is determined to complete the transformation of Slovenia into a full-fledged market-oriented, multi-party parliamentary democracy.
