India's election was postponed today after Tuesday's assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
Gandhi, 46, died after a powerful bomb exploded near a campaign platform in Sriperumbudur, about 30 miles from Madras, the capital of Tamil Nadu.
At least 14 other people died in the blast.
There was no evidence as to who was responsible, but speculation focused on Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a Tamil separatist guerilla force that has assassinated dozens of political enemies.
Rajiv Gandhi became prime minister in 1984 after the assassination of his mother Indira Gandhi by Sikh militants.
