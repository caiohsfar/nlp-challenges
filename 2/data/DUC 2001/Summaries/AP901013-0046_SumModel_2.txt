The Egyptian government said today that Iraqi agents or Egyptian Moslem fundamentalists were responsible for the assassination Friday of Rifaat el- Mahgoub, its second-highest official.
The Interior Minister said saboteurs with orders from Iraqi President Sadam Hussein had been sent to assassinate Egyptian officials.
This was the first assassination of an Egyptian politician since President Anwar Sadat was killed by Islamic extremists nine years ago.
The newspaper Al-Ahram reported that Moslem extremists were collaborating with Palestinian terrorists sent by Iraq and that El-Mahgoub was assassinated to tell the terrorists' bosses that they had pierced the stability of Egypt.
