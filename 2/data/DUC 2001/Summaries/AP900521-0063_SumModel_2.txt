The AIDS epidemic and a concurrent increase in tuberculosis (TB) were discussed at a recent World Conference on Lung Health in Boston.
TB cases have risen 5 percent since 1989 in the U.S. and 35 percent in Newark, N.J.
The conference recommended TB screening at places where AIDS tests are administered.
TB is highly contagious and spread by airborne particles.
Millions of Americans carry the germ, but the disease does not develop unless the immune system is weakened.
Although preventable and curable, if untreated 50 percent of victims die within two years.
Three million people die from TB worldwide each year.
