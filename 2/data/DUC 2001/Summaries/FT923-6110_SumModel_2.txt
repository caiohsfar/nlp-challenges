It is estimated that damage caused by Hurricane Andrew could rise to $20 billion, making it one on the costliest storms of the century.
Twelve lives have been lost in the US, three in the Bahamas.
The town of Homestead, Florida, 10-15 miles south of Miami was largely flattened, including the local air force base.
The storm has still not reached landfall along the Gulf coast.
Companies with heavy storm exposure are State Farm, Allstate, American International Group, Hartford, Aetna and Travellers.
State Farm believes it had roughly 20% of the Florida market; 12% of Travellers' home insurance premium came from Florida.
