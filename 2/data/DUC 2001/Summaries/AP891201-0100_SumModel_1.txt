Serbia on Tuesday banned all political and economic contacts with Slovenia.
The government of Slovenia said Friday that Serbia is attempting to "oust us from Yugoslavia," and called Serbia's action "a flagrant violation of all constitutional, legal and civilized norms."
Liberal, prosperous Slovenia and the hard-line communist leadership of Serbia have been feuding for years, but the Serbian action on Tuesday was the gravest threat to the unity of the Yugoslav federation since Tito's death in 1980.
Slovenia advocates regional autonomy and has scheduled the regions first multi-party elections next spring while Serbia insists on a centralized federation with a single Communist Party.
