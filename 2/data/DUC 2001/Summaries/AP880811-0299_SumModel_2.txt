President Reagan signed a $3.9 billion disaster relief bill aimed at helping drought- stricken farmers.
Harvests of corn, wheat, soybeans, oats, barley and sorghum are predicted to be down 24 to 45 percent from last year.
They may only reach 88 percent of 1977 levels, the Agriculture Department's standard of comparison.
However, because of large pre-season stocks, total supplies are enough in most cases to assure adequate food supplies for home and foreign customers and to meet our food-aid commitments.
The department predicts food price increases this year of 3 to 5 percent, up from the pre- drought expectations of 2 to 4 percent.
