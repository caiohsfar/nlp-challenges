The Senate voted Friday to bar the Census Bureau from counting illegal aliens in the 1990 census.
A Senate-House conference committee will decide whether the prohibition is retained in the appropriations bill for the State, Justice and Commerce departments.
It is expected that House conferees will resist the Senate ban.
The Secretary of Commerce has said he will ask President Bush to veto any such provision that might reach his desk.
Sen Moynihan (D-N.Y.) observed that the government had counted all inhabitants for 190 years and advised against "fiddling with the numbers."
Sen. Cochran (R-Miss.)
, on the other hand, opined that "...illegal aliens ought to be deported, not counted."
