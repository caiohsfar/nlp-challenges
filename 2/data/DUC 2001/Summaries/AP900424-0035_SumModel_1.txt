Elizabeth Taylor was moved into intensive care at St John's Hospital on Friday.
Hospital officials said that her condition was stabilizing after a biopsy was taken to determine the cause of the severe pneumonia.
She has been put on a ventilator to assist her breathing.
Her doctors said that she was seriously ill, but that they were pleased with her progress.
A spokeswoman said that her family was with her, but that too much should not be read into that, and that Ms. Taylor was not on her deathbed.
