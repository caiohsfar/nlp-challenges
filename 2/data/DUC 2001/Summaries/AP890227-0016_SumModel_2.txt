The arrival of spring in Texas and other states in the U.S. heartland brings with it the tornado season.
To keep loss of life and property damage to a minimum, the National Weather Service and emergency personnel advise the following: a. Make safety plans before a tornado strikes.
b. Know the difference between a tornado watch (conditions suitable for tornado development) and a tornado warning (one has already developed.)
c.
A warning means to take cover immediately and stay inside.
If in a car or mobile home, take cover in a ditch.
If at home, stay in the basement or a shelter.
