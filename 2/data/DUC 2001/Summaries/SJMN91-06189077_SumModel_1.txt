Thursday's eclipse will consist of a 160 mile-wide lunar shadow that will reach speeds of up to 5000 miles per hour as it races along the earth's surface.
Preparations for an influx of visitors are at a fever pitch in Hawaii and Mexico, both prime viewing areas.
Forty- eight thousand tourists are expected in Hawaii.
Even larger crowds are expected in Mexico because of its proximity to California, and because the eclipse will last seven minutes there and only four minutes in Hawaii.
It will be 2122 before the world sees a total eclipse as long lasting as will be seen in Mexico.
