Are term limits a crusade driven by only one party or ideology?
Many believe the movement is GOP sponsored in order to oust incumbent Democrats.
However, it is now picking up many prominent liberal and Democratic supporters.
One reason is that it would help many people such as blacks, other minorities and women, now excluded from office by incumbents.
Democratic Party leadership still opposes term limits, believing they would result in large GOP gains.
But, as a sign of the times, term-limit opponents are now relying more on judges to stop the movement than on trying to convince voters to reject the idea.
