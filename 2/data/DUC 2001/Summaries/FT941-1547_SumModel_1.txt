Seven universities and research institutes in Germany have been commissioned to examine possible connections between the origins of "mad cow disease" and two human diseases.
Those diseases, Creutzfeldt-Jakob and Gerstmann Straussare are rarely seen, but the German government is trying to convince the European Union that Germany should be allowed to ban the import of British beef.
More than 100,000 cattle in Britain have died after contracting the "mad cow disease".
Fifty cases have been reported in Switzerland, and two in Germany, one of which affected a cow imported from Britain.
