With the November 17 House vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) fast approaching, the Clinton administration's campaign for the pact has shifted into high gear.
The White House will soon announce support for a North American Development Bank to fund projects in communities hit by job losses resulting from NAFTA.
This is expected to garner at least eight votes from Hispanic congressmen.
State by state, undecided congressmen are being invited to the White House where the "war room" counts 110 Republicans in favor, 65-75 Democrats in favor and 20-30 leaning in favor with 218 needed for passage.
