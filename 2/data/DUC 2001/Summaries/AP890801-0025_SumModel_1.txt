Fire has charred more than 1.3 million acres of forest and range land since January in the contiguous United States, compared to 2.1 million acres by this time last year, fire officials said Monday.
Nearly 10,000 firefighters in five Western states are battling hundreds of blazes, most of them sparked by lightening.
Spotty rain and local areas of dry weather have replaced the widespread drought of 1988; however, this season is just starting and a dry August could change everything.
By the of last year, 6 million acres had burned in the West and Alaska, making 1988 the worst fire season in 30 years.
