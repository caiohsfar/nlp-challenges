Debate continues in the House on whether to include the question: "Are you an illegal immigrant?"
on the 1990 census forms and to exclude those answering "yes" from totals used in reapportionment.
Those in favor are largely from states with few illegal aliens.
Those opposed tend to be from states with large populations of illegal aliens.
The Census Bureau is opposed, fearing increasing difficulty getting the cooperation of immigrants.
Opponents seem to have a clear edge in the legal argument but proponents complain, "Illegal aliens are actually taking representation away from Americans."
Both sides predict that the issue will eventually be decided in court.
