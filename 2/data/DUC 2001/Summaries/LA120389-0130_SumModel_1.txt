The 31 category 4 and 5 hurricanes from 1950-1967 profited from abundant rainfall in Africa's Sahel.
Last year's Hurricane Gilbert was the mightiest on record in the Western Hemisphere, with atmospheric pressure dropping to 885 millibars and wind speed reaching 200 mph.
September's Hugo sustained 150 mph winds and atmospheric pressure of 918 millibars.
This century, only two category 5 hurricanes have struck the US with full force: 1935's Labor Day storm that ravaged the Florida Keys and 1969's Camille, which hit Mississippi and Louisiana.
1980's Hurricane Allen, the mightiest recorded Caribbean storm, lost much force before hitting the Gulf Coast of Texas.
