An Associated Press study of the federal $3.9 billion drought relief program shows that the aid really did help those most in need.
North Dakota, the nation's most agriculturally dependent state, received $410.2 million, about 10.5 percent of the total package.
The money not only helped rescue more than 49,000 farmers, it may also have kept the state afloat.
The trickle-down effect of those payments reduced statewide losses to businesses, banks and households from $3.4 billion to $2.1 billion.
The aid program was also critical to Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.
These five states received nearly half of the allocated assistance.
