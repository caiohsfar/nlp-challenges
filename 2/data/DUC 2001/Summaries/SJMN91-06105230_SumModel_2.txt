The last three Boston marathons have turned into reckless speed duels, producing five of the top 10 times in the race's history and becoming races of attrition.
Last year all 11 checkpoint records were shattered through the first 20 miles.
The winner last year was Gelindo Bordin in 2:8:19.
He ran a patient, calculating race and passed everyone at 21 miles.
The historic route begins west of Boston in Hopkinton and ends in Copley Square in Boston's Back Bay section.
Competitors this year have also run in the Olympics, the 1990 Commonwealth Games, and the New York City and London marathons.
