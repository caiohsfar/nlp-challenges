The Center of Disease Control (CDC) highlighted the tuberculosis (TB) rate in U.S. prisons.
A survey in 29 states reveals 31 TB cases per 100,000 prisoners in 1984-1985, with eight cases per 100,000 non-prisoners.
The highest rate was 110 per 100,000 inmates in New Jersey.
TB is a contagious, bacterial lung disease.
As many as 7 percent of Americans have latent TB infections, with about 10 percent someday developing active TB.
Overcrowded prisons are especially conducive to the spread of the disease, although HIV infections may play a part.
The CDC recommended TB testing, chest X- rays, and isolation of TB victims.
