Shining Path guerrillas, who started their bloody uprising in the mountains of Peru eight years ago, are moving into the shantytowns that encircle the country's capital.
The Maoist followers of the movement, once secretive fanatics, are becoming a political force that seeks public support in Huaycan and the other makeshift communities where two- thirds of Lima's 7 million people live.
Shining Path's move into a more public role, and through most of Peru from its Andean base in the province of Ayacucho, has coincided with economic collapse and annual inflation of nearly 2,000 percent.
