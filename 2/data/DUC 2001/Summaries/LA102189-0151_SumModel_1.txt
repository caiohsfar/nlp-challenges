Thursday negotiators from the U.S. Senate and House agreed on including illegal aliens in the 1990 census.
The agreement will go back to each body before it is sent to President Bush, but it is considered likely to be approved.
Officials in Orange County, California were quick to call for counting all residents and opposition to "all attempts to systematically exclude any groups from the census."
It was estimated that exclusion of the county's 200,000 illegal aliens would result in the loss of approximately $56 million a year in federal revenue and possible loss of representatives in Congress.
