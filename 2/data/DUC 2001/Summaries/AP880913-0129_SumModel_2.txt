Today a Navy F-14 jet fighter plunged into the Atlantic off Hatteras, NC.
One crewman is dead, the other missing.
The plane was engaged in mock dogfight training when it crashed.
It was attached to Fighter Squadron 143 at Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia Beach, VA.
Also today, an F-16A assigned to Hill Air Force Base's 388th Tactical Fighter Wing crashed in northern Utah.
The pilot bailed out.
These crashes followed Monday's crash of a Navy plane into a hangar at Gillespie Field at El Cajon, CA, a densely populated area.
Five people, including the two crewmen remain hospitalized.
