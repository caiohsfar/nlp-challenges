Exxon officials Monday released a revised plan for cleansing 364 miles of Alaskan coastline fouled by the nation's largest oil spill.
Since March 24, when an Exxon tanker struck a reef outside Valdez and poured more than 10 million gallons of crude into Prince William Sound, Exxon has financed cleanup crews.
The company's strategy divides Alaska's oil-tainted shores into four categories from the most heavily polluted to the "only lightly oiled."
The worst areas would be targeted immediately.
The gunk or sludge that resists treatment will be burned or buried.
Both methods likely will require exemptions from local environmental laws.
