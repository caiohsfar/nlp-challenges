Saturday, a U.S. Air Force A-10 Thunderbolt II jet crashed into a working-class neighborhood in the central West German city of Remscheid killing six people and severely injuring seven.
Authorities believe the accident will further erode the already sinking public support for national defense programs.
West Germany, a staunch NATO ally, is on the front lines of the East-West struggle.
Even before this fatal crash, 12 major military aircraft accidents had killed 95 people this year alone in Germany's crowded skies, including 70 deaths resulting from the crash at an air show at the U.S. base in Ramstein in August.
