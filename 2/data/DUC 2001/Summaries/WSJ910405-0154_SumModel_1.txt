The brutal beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles policemen offers convincing evidence that a code of silence exists within that department.
Four officers took turns kicking and beating an unresisting victim for more than two minutes.
These criminals in uniform would not have dared their brutality had they feared that any of the 17 others officers watching would report their criminal actions.
Police Chiefs across the country seem to be just as reluctant to criticize a fellow chief.
The culture of the department that allowed the brutalizing of Rodney King was created under Chief Daryl Gates's leadership.
Yet his fellow police chiefs have remained silent for years about Mr. Gates.
