The National Rifle Association (NRA), despite several setbacks in recent years, is fighting back with a vengeance.
The high pressure lobbying and targeting of incumbents with whom they disagree is particularly evident in Arizona and Florida.
The target in Arizona is U.S. Senator Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.)
, sponsor of a bill to ban the sale of assault weapons.
In Florida the NRA lobbies the state legislature incessantly in opposition to restrictions on assault weapons and other gun control measures.
At the national level the NRA President warns, "But look at what happened in Germany when ol' Hitler did a good job in disarming the nation."
