Elizabeth Taylor underwent a lung biopsy on Monday to further determine the cause of her pneumonia.
A prominent pulmonary specialist who is not involved in caring for Ms. Taylor said that the taking of a biopsy was a prudent measure and one that will guide her doctors in setting the course of her therapy.
Taylor is now 58 years old.
In 1961 she suffered a near-fatal bout with pneumonia.
The same pulmonary specialist cited above said that her history suggests that there may be a basic problem with her lung structure or function.
