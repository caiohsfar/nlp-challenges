In-mid June, a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department was settled when police agreed to stop using a martial-arts weapon, nunchakus, against anti-abortion advocates.
Hundreds have charged that police have used excessive force in 50 cities across the United States against demonstrators, most associated with Operation Rescue, intent on closing down abortion clinics.
The settlement over police use of nunchakus and other painful tactics against anti- abortion demonstrators receive little attention from civil right groups, the public or the press.
That may reflect a lack of public support for groups who attempt to close facilities to deny the rights of others.
