A huge C-5A transport plane carrying materials for U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia crashed just outside of Ramstein Air Base in Germany.
Thirteen of the seventeen crewmembers died.
The remaining four are hospitalized in satisfactory condition.
Nine of those killed and one of those injured are reservists with the 433rd Military Airlift Wing from Kelly AFB, San Antonio.
The four others were stationed at Ramstein or at nearby Hahn Air Base.
The plane was from the 60th Military Airlift Squadron, Travis AFB, California and was en route to Rhein-Mein Air Base near Frankfurt.
This was the first C5-A crash in fifteen years.
