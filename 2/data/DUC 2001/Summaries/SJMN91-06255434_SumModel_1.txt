On September 11, 1991, as Clarence Thomas waits for his U.S. Supreme Court Justice confirmation, the media was focusing on his wife, Virginia.
The question foremost in their minds was, how much influence will she have on Clarence Thomas' decisions if he is confirmed?
Some see her as more than a dutiful wife.
She has lobbied against comparable-worth legislation.
Religious rights groups are concerned by her anti-cult activities.
Other critics believe that since his wife is white, Thomas has rejected his black roots and lacks a sense of community.
Both Thomases believe that women and minorities are harmed by affirmative action.
