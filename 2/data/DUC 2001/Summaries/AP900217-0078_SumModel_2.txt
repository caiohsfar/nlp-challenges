The AIDS epidemic is bringing a resurgence of tuberculosis (TB).
There are now a number of treatments available for AIDS and AIDS-related infections and work is encouraging in research for a vaccine.
An epidemic of TB is appearing in AIDS patients who had been exposed to TB early in life, but before AIDS were able to fight off the bacteria.
Homeless people are also at an elevated risk for TB.
TB again is becoming an inner city problem, as in New York City where TB declined between 1960 and 1977, but is now increasing--reaching the 1960 level again.
