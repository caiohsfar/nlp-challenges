A joint military-prosecution investigation team which probed the assassination of South Korean President Pak Chong-hui by then Central Intelligence Agency Director Kim Chae-kyu in October 1979 found no evidence that then Army Chief of Staff and martial law commander, Gen. Chong Sung-hwa was an accomplice in the crime.
Chong was nearby when Kim killed Pak and was subsequently arrested and indicted on a charge of high treason despite a lack of concrete evidence.
The Seoul District Prosecutor's Office is looking into a criminal suit filed by victims of the Dec. 12, 1979 arrests including Chong.
