Yugoslav federal military commanders who met in March to consider ways to quell dissent in Slovenia concluded that "dissident tendencies" in Slovenia were part of a foreign-backed conspiracy to overthrow the country's Communist government, but they did not discuss a plan of action against the "conspiracy."
Slovenian police later denied that there was such a conspiracy.
Slovenia is considered the most liberal of Yugoslavia's six republics.
Slovenian Communists have frequently criticized the way the federal government is dealing with the country's economic and social problems.
Some army commanders have complained that Slovenia's leadership has failed to act firmly against political dissidents.
