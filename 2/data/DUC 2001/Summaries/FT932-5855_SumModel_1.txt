US Hispanics are deeply divided on whether to endorse NAFTA, preventing the congressional Hispanic caucus from taking a stand on the issue.
Important Hispanic coalitions fear that Hispanics in the US would bear the brunt of the negative impact of NAFTA and have proposed a North American Development Bank to give financial help to regions of the US, Mexico, and Canada most affected negatively by NAFTA.
One union representative said most Hispanics would be losers unless there are basic changes in the proposal.
On the other hand, Hispanic business organizations are enthusiastic supporters of NAFTA and fear that any side agreements could jeopardize the pact.
