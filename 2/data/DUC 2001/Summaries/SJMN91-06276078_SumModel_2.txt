Poor ventilation systems in modern office buildings are recycling old, stale air and spreading airborne infections.
Various studies have found instances where tuberculosis, measles, and flu were spread throughout sealed, modern office buildings that added little or no fresh air.
Other places where infections spread rapidly include airplanes, pediatricians' offices, prisons, hospitals, and homeless shelters.
Adding 15, or even less than 10, cubic feet per minute of outdoor air has become common.
Adding even 35 cubic feet per minute as recommended in Massachusetts would significantly decrease infection's spread, but can be expensive.
