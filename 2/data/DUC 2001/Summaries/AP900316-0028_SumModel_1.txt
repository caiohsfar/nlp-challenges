The steady decline in tuberculosis (TB) has almost stopped.
According to the Centers for Disease Control the 1988 rate was down 0.4 percent from 1987.
This drop compares with an average annual decrease of 6.7 percent in the early 1980's.
This slowing is attributed to the increase of TB in patients with HIV-related illnesses.
In the U.S. in 1988, TB rates were 4.1 per 100,000 whites; 28.3 per 100,000 blacks; 18.3 for Hispanics and 36.3 for Asians and Pacific Islanders.
More than 115,000 Americans were under treatment in 1987.
An estimated 10,000,000 Americans are infected with the TB bacteria, but the vast majority will never become ill.
