Saturday Hispanics can attend a free half-day clinic to learn how to manage diabetes.
Heredity and diet appear to be the reason that 14% to 21% of Hispanics -- and up to 40% in the 64-75 age group -- contract diabetes.
The clinic will focus on diet, exercise and medication with particular emphasis on cooking with unsaturated fats.
The high-fat diet of many Hispanics leads to obesity which seems to trigger diabetes.
The hospital and the diabetes society are sponsoring the clinic which will be taught by bilingual instructors.
Previous programs dating back to 1984 were not reaching the monolingual Spanish-speaker.
