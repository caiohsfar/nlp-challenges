Today's eclipse will begin in San Jose at 10:10 A.M., peak at 11:20 A.M. and end at 12:34 P.M.
In this area only about half of the sun's diameter will be blacked out by the moon.
The sun will be totally eclipsed in Hawaii and Mexico.
The next major eclipse will not occur until the middle of the 22nd century.
Experts have warned the public not to look at the eclipse without special glasses to safeguard the eyes.
Failure to heed those warnings could cause burning of the retina, and permanent damage to the eyes.
