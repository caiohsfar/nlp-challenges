A Northwest Airlines MD-82 aircraft crashed on 16 August 1987 in Detroit killing 154 people.
The plane was previously involved in two other incidents of engine failure.
It was the second deadliest aircraft accident in U.S. history.
Flight recorders have been recovered.
Engine failure is a likely cause.
The JT8D-200 series engine, the type aboard the MD-82, is of some concern to safety officials because of the number of incidents involving this engine.
There is pressure now for a complete review of air safety.
Between 1960 and 1985, there were 10 aircraft crashes by U.S. domestic carriers resulting in 1348 deaths.
