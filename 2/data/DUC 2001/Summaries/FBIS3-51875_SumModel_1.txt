In a statement made during a television interview in Peru, subversion specialist Carlos Tapia said he believes the Shining Path does not intend to seek reconciliation in the country, has disarmed itself neither militarily nor ideologically, and is instead trying to become a semi-legal political party operating as a shock force against the opposition.
Tapia emphasized that the Shining Path faction led by Abimael Guzman Reinoso enjoys government favor and has been given assistance in organizing a second party congress.
Tapia also stated that imprisoned Shining Path members have been allowed to tour several prisons and to promote debates.
