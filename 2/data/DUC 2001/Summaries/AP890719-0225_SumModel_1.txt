The U.S. Senate has passed an amendment directing the Census Bureau for the first time to exclude illegal aliens from its count in the 1990 census, but it is unlikely to be approved by the House in time for the head count next year.
Opponents of the amendment argue that it is both unconstitutional and unworkable.
The constitution says that apportionment of congressional seats will be based on "the whole number of persons in each state" and makes no mention of citizenship in this regard.
The Census Bureau says the amendment would make the job of an accurate count more difficult than ever.
