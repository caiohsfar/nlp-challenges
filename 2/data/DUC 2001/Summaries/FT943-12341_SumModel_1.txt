More than 150 geophysical instruments in Japan's coastal Tokai region tracks seismic activity, rock strain, crustal tilt, tidal movements and ground water levels.
The data are telemetered to Tokyo where they are monitored around the clock in the hope that experts there will recognize unusual phenomena that may indicate an imminent earthquake.
Long after the rest of the world has abandoned hope of predicting earthquakes, Japan continues to spend 2.5m dollars a year monitoring the Tokai region and close to 100m dollars more on general earthquake prediction research.
Skeptics say it is at best a misguided effort that wastes money and is dangerously misleading to the public.
