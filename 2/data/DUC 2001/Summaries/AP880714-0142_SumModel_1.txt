The National Weather Service reports that in early July, 29 percent of the nation was undergoing severe or extreme drought.
The drought has expanded eastward from the Rockies into the Great Lakes, Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, and into the Mid-Atlantic states.
This drought is about equivalent to that of 1911, but less severe than those of the 1930s or 1956.
However, in the Midwest, large areas have experienced the driest April- June period since 1895.
The 30-day weather forecast offers little hope for improvement.
Portions of the Mississippi Valley have some relief due to recent rains, as have portions of Texas.
