Prospects for the on-time completion of the "chunnel" have brightened, but Britain will not build a high-speed rail link from London to Folkestone.
The government's announcement yesterday intensified an 18-month old squabble.
Opposition leaders have contended that without a high-speed link Britain will not realize the full benefits of the tunnel.
Thatcher claims two billion pounds have already been earmarked for infrastructure.
Without the high-speed link passengers will speed from Paris to Calais at 180 miles an hour, slow to 100 in the tunnel, and crawl from Folkestone to London at 60 miles per hour.
