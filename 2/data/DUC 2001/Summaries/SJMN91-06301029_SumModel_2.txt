Local firefighters in the South Bay area are looking at the hills and wondering not whether, but only when and where.
Severe firestorms have already devastated the Oakland hills.
Fire officials have pinpointed ten areas that show the greatest potential for severe firestorms.
These areas are heavily wooded, with wood homes, and shake roofs with winding roads that make travel difficult in an emergency.
Local fire officials point out that deliberately set fires increase the danger and frequency of the problem.
Privacy has a high price.
City dwellers are attracted to the wooded seclusion but exact a cost in fire protection according to rescue workers.
