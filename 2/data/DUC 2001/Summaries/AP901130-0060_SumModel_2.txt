In 1988 and 1989, the near normal rainfall in West Africa's Sahel, the semi-arid land on the southern fringe of the Sahara Desert, may have spawned Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 and Hugo in 1989.
Gilbert wracked the Caribbean and Hugo devastated South Carolina, two of the most destructive Atlantic hurricanes ever.
In this year's season, eight of the 14 named storms became hurricanes, over the average of nine storms and six hurricanes.
Hurricane Diana, sweeping into Mexico in early August, was the most deadly.
It caused flash floods and mudslides that killed 96 people, and extensive damage to roads, property and agriculture.
