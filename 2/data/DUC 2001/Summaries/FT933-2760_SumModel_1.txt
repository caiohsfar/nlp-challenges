Pro- and anti- forces in the battle over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) displayed their respective strengths this week.
President Clinton and former Presidents Bush, Carter and Ford all endorsed NAFTA.
Opponents interrupted a House hearing to unfurl an anti-NAFTA banner and succeeded in getting extensive free TV coverage.
Meanwhile polls showed growing public opposition to the trade pact with 36% of those polled opposed and 25% in favor.
A Greenpeace release claimed that the agreement threatens two decades of work on environmental protection, but Vice President Gore and several established environmental leaders praised the environmental safeguards negotiated in NAFTA's side pact.
