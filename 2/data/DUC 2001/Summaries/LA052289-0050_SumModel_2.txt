In Yellowstone National Park last summer's spectacular season of fire scorched enough timber and meadow to rival Rhode Island in size.
Despite infernos that whipped through the treetops like blast furnaces, most of the pristine landscape emerged unscathed.
Spring has come and arguments still rage over the impact of the fires on wildlife, the conduct of officials responsible for monitoring the blazes.
While the response from tourists is still questionable, the park is bracing for an unprecedented onslaught of scientists looking into fire behavior patterns, its effects on grizzly bears, fisheries, grasslands and the nesting status of bald eagles.
