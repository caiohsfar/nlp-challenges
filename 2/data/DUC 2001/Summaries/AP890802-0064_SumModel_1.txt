The House has blocked an effort to exclude aliens from the census numbers used in reapportionment.
Undocumented aliens are concentrated in the South, West, and industrial states like New York, and other states fear a loss of power to those areas if the aliens are counted.
Although all residents have been counted in previous censuses and the Constitution requires that apportionment be based on all the "persons" residing in a state, the issue remains active in House committees and on the floor.
One proponent of excluding aliens stated that their inclusion in the count "... may be constitutional, but it's just not right."
