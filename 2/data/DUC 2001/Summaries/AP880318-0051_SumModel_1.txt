Earlier today the sun was blacked out by the shadow of the moon for up to four minutes along a 108-mile swath that moved from the Indian Ocean across Indonesia and the southern Philippine Island of Mindanao.
The eclipse was partial across a wide area of Asia and parts of Australia.
Natives danced, banged drums and participated in other traditional activities in celebration of the phenomenon.
Despite some cloud cover, scientists were able to take pictures of the eclipse.
Eclipses occur when the moon is positioned between the earth and the sun.
The Chinese first recorded an eclipse in 2137 B.C.
