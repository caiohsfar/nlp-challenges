A U.S. military F-16C crashed today in a remote area of Iwate Prefecture (State) about 290 miles north of Tokyo.
The pilot, Maj. Wyman E. Vanedoe, baled out safely and was taken by a Japanese rescue helicopter to Misawa Air Base where he is listed in good condition.
The aircraft from the 14th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Misawa was on a routine training flight when it crashed.
About 50 F-16s are stationed at Misawa.
On March 22, 1987, another F-16 crashed in the Pacific Ocean off Misawa, 360 miles north of Tokyo.
In that crash the pilot was also rescued.
