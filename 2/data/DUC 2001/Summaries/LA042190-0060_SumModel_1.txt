The Los Angeles District Attorney's office has declined to press charges against several doctors who had allegedly over-prescribed painkillers for Elizabeth Taylor.
The announcement came Friday as the investigation into the charges ended.
The District Attorney's office said that the prescribing procedures fell below the accepted medical standard, but refused to charge the physicians with criminal intent.
The report said that one doctor had repeatedly tried to convince Ms. Taylor to enter a rehabilitation center.
Taylor rejected that, but eventually acknowledged a 35-year addiction to pills and alcohol, and entered the Betty Ford Clinic in Rancho Mirage.
