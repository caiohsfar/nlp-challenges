Slovenian enterprises are looking for trading partners in the European Community to compensate for lost markets in the former Yugoslavia.
Until 1990 over 30% of Slovenia's exports were with the former Yugoslavia.
After an embargo by Serbia on Slovene imports in 1990 and ensuing warfare in neighboring Croatia, Slovene Exports to the former Yugoslavia have fallen by 85%, and as a result industrial production dropped last year by 15% and will fall another 12% this year.
Unemployment has risen from 9% to 11% of the labor force.
Germany, Italy, France and Austria are now Slovenia's main trading partners.
