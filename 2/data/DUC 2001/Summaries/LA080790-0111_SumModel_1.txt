Police attacked former Cincinnati Reds second baseman Joe Morgan knocking him to the floor and handcuffing him in Los Angeles International Airport.
The plainclothes detective, Clayton Searle was looking for the companion of a suspected drug courier.
The 46-year old Morgan is suing the city of Los Angeles in federal court, claiming that he was unfairly targeted because he is a black and fit a certain "profile" that narcotics think a drug courier should look like.
Last year the Supreme Court ruled that government agents may stop and question airline passengers who look and act like drug "couriers" but not just on race or appearance.
