Since Hispanics are three times as prone to diabetes as the general US population, researchers in Texas have conducted family studies, hoping to identify the gene that triggers the disease.
Upper-income Mexican Americans have a lower risk of the disease than those of lower-income, suggesting that although the gene may be there, diet and life style affect the chance of acquiring the disease.
Accordingly, the researchers encourage programs to educate school-age children about the importance of healthy diets and exercise.
Researchers are also working on an anti-diabetic drug called metaforim that improves the body's ability to respond to insulin.
