Actress Elizabeth Taylor and the National Enquirer have reached a settlement of Ms. Taylor's lawsuit against the tabloid.
Taylor sought damages of 20 million dollars for two articles published by the Enquirer in June 1990 that reported on Taylor's medical problems and her drinking when pneumonia caused her lengthy hospitalization.
Neither side discussed the terms of the agreement, but Taylor's attorney said it was large enough that a trial should not be pursued.
The tabloid also apologized, saying that after seeing all of Taylor's medical records, it was evident that inaccurate information had been published.
Taylor said that she felt "completely vindicated".
