TransManche Link, the construction consortium that is building the "chunnel", said a historic linkup occurred Tuesday 13 miles southeast of Folkestone and 10 miles northwest of Sangatte.
Each of the three tunnels starts a few miles inland and is 31 miles long.
The drilling, done by gargantuan machines, is now about 80 percent complete.
It has been a very costly venture.
Seven workers on the British side, and two on the French side have been killed in construction accidents.
The initial estimated cost of 9.4 billion dollars has risen to 16.7 billion dollars.
