The British Office of Fair Trade said Tuesday that it was investigating a complaint alleging anti-competitive practices by the De Beers-controlled Selling Organization.
De Beers is a South African company but its Selling Organization has been based in London for 60 years.
The Selling Organization sells diamonds mined by De Beers in South Africa, and trades on behalf of diamonds produced in other countries, including Zaire, Botswana, Australia, and the Soviet Union.
Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, a British mining concern, filed the complaint, saying that it wanted to spotlight the "monopolistic tendencies" of the South African company.
