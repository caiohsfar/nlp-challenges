Robert Goldwin notes that critics of his recent gun-control article show great passion but apparently don't read very well.
The article says nothing about removing all guns from American citizens.
It affirms that there is an undeniable right to own a gun.
All of the critics missed his point that gun owners should "sign up" with (not "join") the National Guard as a means of providing some control over who owns what kinds of weapons.
The Second Amendment protects the right of citizens to serve as defenders of the community, not the personal uses of guns.
It is no barrier to sensible gun control.
