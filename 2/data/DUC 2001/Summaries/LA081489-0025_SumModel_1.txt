On 13 August 1989, a U.S. military helicopter finally located the crash site of a plane with Congressman Mickey Leland (D-Texas) and 15 others aboard.
There were no survivors.
The plane had hit a mountain peak in Ethiopia on 7 August in heavy weather.
Leland and his party were touring refugee camps along the Ethiopian-Sudanese border to determine food aid requirements for the poor.
The recovery of bodies is in progress.
Leland was noted for his compassion for the poor.
He represented a black and Hispanic community in Houston.
He won his most recent election with 96 percent of the vote.
