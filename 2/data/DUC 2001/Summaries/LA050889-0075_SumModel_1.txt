The Long Beach Marathon Sunday had its largest-ever field with 4,021 entrants.
Rex Wilson of New Zealand won in 2:12:27 and Wen Yanmin of China won in 2:43:33, each setting course records and winning $9,500.
Robert Molinatti of Huntington Beach won the wheelchair division in 1:47:59.
The Pacific Rim Marathon, of teams from invited countries, was run within the marathon.
The men's and women's winners shrewdly waited for others to make mistakes and the sun to take its toll.
Wilson wanted to run at a 5-minute pace so was forced to take the lead at ten miles.
He commented that he hated marathons.
