Today, the 19th of April, 1988, is a day that will live in the memory of residents of Madison, Florida.
A tornado plowed through this town of 3500 people at dawn.
It destroyed homes, a college library, killed four people and injured 15.
It cut a 12-mile path of destruction.
Mobile homes took the brunt of the tornado's fury.
Other adjacent counties in northeast Florida were also hit by separate tornadoes.
The neighboring state of Georgia was also hit by hail storms, high winds, heavy rain and tornadoes.
Once again, a number of mobile homes were destroyed or damaged.
