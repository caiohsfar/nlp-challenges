Several states are considering term-limit restrictions for state lawmakers.
Ross K. Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers University, says this is illogical.
There is a lack of connection between the fancied sins of the lawmakers and the discipline proposed.
A weakness of state legislatures often results from the amateurism of the lawmakers, a trait now seen as a virtue.
Lobbyists and unelected legislative staff would benefit.
They are permanent and outside the accountability of voters.
If what reformers want is to throw out the rascals, these measures are more like burning down your house to get rid of the rats.
