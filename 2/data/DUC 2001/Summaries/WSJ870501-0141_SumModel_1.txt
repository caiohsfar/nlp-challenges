The Shining Path rebels represent themselves as defenders of impoverished Peruvian coca farmers.
Shining Path guerrillas demand that farmers pay for protection from anti- drug police with one-fifth of their coca crop.
In the late 1970s, poor farmers began replacing their fields of cacao and coffee with coca.
Like thousands of other farmers they discovered that coca could make them rich.
The large profits have also attracted the murderous Shining Path to the jungles of northeast Lima.
An embarrassed U.S. government's anti-drug effort may have aggravated the situation by pushing coca growers closer to the guerrillas.
