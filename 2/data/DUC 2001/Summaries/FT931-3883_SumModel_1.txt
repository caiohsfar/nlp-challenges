It was reported this week that a dairy farmer, Mr. Peter Warhurst, died last year of Creutzfeldt Jakob disease.
Mr. Warhurst's herd had a case of "mad cow disease", or BSE, in 1989.
Both BSE and CJD are caused by mysterious particles of infectious protein called prions The British government maintains that beef can be eaten safely, and that there is no causal link between BSE and CJD.
The death of the dairy farmer and the continued rise in the number of cases of BSE has fueled the growing public anxiety surrounding bovine encephalopathy.
