On 3 March 1991, a United Air Lines Boeing 737 with 25 passengers and crew nosed into the ground a few miles south of Colorado Springs airport killing all on board.
There was no immediate cause known for the crash but wind shear was one possibility.
It comes at a time in which the travel industry is in the doldrums from fears of terrorism, etc.
The National Weather Service in Colorado Springs issued a wind shear warning two hours before the crash.
The last wind shear accident occurred in 1985 in Dallas.
Resources have been directed to deal with this threat.
