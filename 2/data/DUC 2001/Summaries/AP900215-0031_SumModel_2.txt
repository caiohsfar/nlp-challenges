According to a study released today which looks at 25,398 nursing home residents in Arkansas, blacks are twice as likely to get infected with the tuberculosis (TB) bacteria as whites living under the same conditions.
Prison data from Arkansas and Minnesota contain the same conclusion.
Overall, blacks suffer six times more TB than whites.
Ten million Americans are infected with the TB bacteria, with about 22,000 active cases and 1,700 deaths reported annually.
Additional studies suggest that whites have evolved better defenses against TB, long active in Europe, and there is a racial difference in the resistance of germ-eating blood cells.
