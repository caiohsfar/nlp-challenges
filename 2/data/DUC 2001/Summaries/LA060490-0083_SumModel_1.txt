The enigmatic brain disorder known as "mad cow disease" is causing friction among European trading partners, and is threatening the 3.7 billion dollar British beef industry.
The British government insists that the disease is not a threat to humans, but consumers are not buying that argument.
The British press has been making a big deal of the Ministry of Agriculture's report that a Siamese cat had died of a disease similar to "mad cow", saying that it proved that other species, including humans, were vulnerable.
West Germany and France have banned the import of British beef.
