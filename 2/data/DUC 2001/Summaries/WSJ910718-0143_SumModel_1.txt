The idea of term limits for legislators is not new.
We once had them.
They kept James Madison out of legislative service at a critical time during our early nation building years.
However, the constitutional convention unanimously rejected them and the First Congress soundly defeated two subsequent term-limit proposals.
Today we hear many of the same pro and con arguments that were expressed then.
Robert Livingston may have said it best, "The people are the best judges [of] who ought to represent them.
To dictate and control them, to tell them who they shall not elect, is to abridge their natural rights."
