After a year and a half in office, World Bank President Barber Conable has failed to move the bank into a leadership role on the Third World debt problem.
While the debt morass has deepened, Mr. Conable's World Bank has looked inward, shuffling its organization charts around in a disruptive reorganization and then campaigning for a $74.8 billion increase in its capital.
While defending his approach to the debt problem, Mr. Conable explains: "We aren't a financial institution but a development institution."
But critics reject that view.
Even some Reagan administration officials privately despair of Mr. Conable's leadership and fear that it may have been a mistake to appoint him.
