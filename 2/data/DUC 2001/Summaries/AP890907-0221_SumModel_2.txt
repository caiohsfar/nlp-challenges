In a nation where economic chaos reigns and few laws are respected, the Shining Path is setting down clear rules and making them stick.
The guerrillas have banned drug abuse, prostitution, homosexuality and thievery from the villages they control in Peru's Upper Huallaga River Valley.
"In a sense, they enforce a hyper-Christian morality--except they kill you if you break the rules," said the Rev. Paul Feeley, a Canadian Roman Catholic priest working in Aucayacu, 255 miles northeast of Lima.
The Shining Path enjoys the support of tens of thousands of farmers in the jungle of Upper Huallaga Valley, the world's largest source of coca leaf.
