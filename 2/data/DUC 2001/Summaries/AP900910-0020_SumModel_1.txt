The latest analysis of the effects of the 1988 drought done by the Agriculture Department indicates that the drought wasn't as bad as it might have been.
Crop yields plummeted, but commodity prices rose.
So it was not too bad for those who eked out some production or had grain stored from previous years.
Higher market prices helped reduce the direct payments to farmers under USDA's commodity programs.
Despite the drought, farms in all areas of the country continued to improve their solvency position in 1988 and the number of farms considered financially vulnerable continued to decrease in both drought and non-drought areas.
