One in eight Latino adults is afflicted by diabetes.
It is thought that genetically controlled defects in the body's insulin system cause a basic susceptibility, but Latino diets rich in high-calorie fried foods that promote obesity increase the chance of getting diabetes.
Doctors say that the diabetes most common among Latinos can be largely prevented with proper diet and exercise.
The number of Latino diabetics in the U.S. will reach 8 million by the year 2000 at a cost of more than $10 billion a year according to projections by Eli Lilly Co.
New educational efforts are necessary.
Prevention is the best policy.
