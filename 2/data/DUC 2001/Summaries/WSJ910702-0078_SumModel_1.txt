Dinesh D'Souza of the Wall Street Journal interviewed Clarence Thomas prior to his appointment to the Supreme court to obtain his views.
Thomas stated that he did not believe in quotas because the U.S. was founded on individual rights rather than group rights.
Thomas' philosophy is that a judge should determine what the law says, not what he wants it to say.
He has held fast to the ideals of his grandfather, i.e., hard work, personal dignity and self- sufficiency.
Thomas has a passion for fairness and so far, has confounded the experts who try to fit him into a mold.
