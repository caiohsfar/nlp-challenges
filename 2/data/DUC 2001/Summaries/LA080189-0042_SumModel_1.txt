Hurricane Chantal, first of the season and third named storm, is expected to reach the Louisiana or Texas coast this afternoon or evening.
Yesterday its winds capsized an oil- drilling work vessel 25 miles south of Morgan City, LA, trapping up to 10 crew members inside.
The search for survivors was called off in late afternoon when winds were over 60 mph and waves 12 feet high and building.
Chantal was then 200 miles SSE of Galveston, traveling NW at 10 mph.
It was soon classified a hurricane and later reported to have 75 mph winds.
Tides 5-7 feet above normal were expected.
