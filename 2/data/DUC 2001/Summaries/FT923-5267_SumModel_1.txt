Industry authorities say US insurers expect to pay an estimated $7.3 billion for Hurricane Andrew claim damage in Florida.
This amount does not include projected costs for claims in Louisiana.
On Florida claims alone, Andrew becomes the costliest single insured catastrophe in US history.
In total, projected Andrew claims will exceed the record $7.6 paid out in 1989 for Hurricane Hugo ($4.2 billion) and the Loma Prieta earthquake in California.
The Los Angeles riots earlier this year, the most expensive civil disturbance ever, cost $775 million.
The property-casualty industry is thought to have adequate funds to cover the Hurricane Andrew disaster.
