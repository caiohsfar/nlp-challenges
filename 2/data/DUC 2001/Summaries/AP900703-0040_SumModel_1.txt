On Monday Slovenia's parliament declared the republic's full sovereignty, but stopped short of calling for secession.
A coalition of center-right parties formed a new government in Slovenia last month after overwhelming reform Communists in the first free elections held in Communist-ruled Yugoslavia in 45 years.
The new government demands that Yugoslavia transform itself into a loose confederation of sovereign states and threatens to declare full independence if the remaining republics do not agree.
The hard-line Communist government in the largest republic of Serbia vehemently opposes turning Yugoslavia into a confederation and has made no plans for free elections.
