The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states: "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
As with all ten amendments constituting the Bill of Rights, this amendment specified an area in which the states are protected from the federal government's making any laws.
The Second Amendment did not create a federally protected right of individuals but was an express limitation on the powers of the national government to limit or deny the states the right to have a state militia.
