The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote shortly on a new 5.2 billion dollar welfare spending bill.
It is described as a reform bill but in reality, it pays only lip service to welfare reform.
The bill's proponents view the bill as a necessary expenditure for special education, training and work programs for welfare mothers to encourage them to find jobs.
Both parties in the House of Representatives believe that welfare-to-work programs are valuable; however, the number of long-term welfare dependents has increased.
Valid welfare reform should shrink the number of welfare dependents and enhance the work ethic.
