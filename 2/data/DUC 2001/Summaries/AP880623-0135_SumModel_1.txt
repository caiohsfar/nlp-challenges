There was vigorous debate in the House Census Subcommittee Thursday over whether illegal aliens should be counted in the 1990 census.
On the one side it was argued that states with large numbers of illegal aliens benefit unfairly getting extra house seats as a result of having residents who have violated the law while the rights of honest citizens in other states are violated as they lose representation in the House.
On the other side it was pointed out that the Constitution requires a count of all the "persons" in the country for purposes of reapportionment and does not specify citizens.
