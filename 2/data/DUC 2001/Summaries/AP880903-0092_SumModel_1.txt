President Reagan has informed the Congress that he will veto any welfare reform legislation that does not contain a work requirement.
Although unemployment remains at one of its lowest levels in years, the president believes that there are still people caught in the welfare trap.
He is urging the states to design their own plans for getting people off of welfare.
Democrats favor a current House-passed bill that would make welfare recipients who work better off than those who do not.
This bill leaves the requirement that a recipient work to state and local governments which administer the programs.
