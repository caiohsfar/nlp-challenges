Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy or BSE is commonly known as "mad cow disease".
The disease was first diagnosed in 1986, and exhibits symptoms to those of scrapie, a sheep disease that has been seen in England since the 1700s.
The incurable disease eats holes in the brains of its victims, and in its later stages causes the animals to act skittish or stagger drunkenly.
As of February this year the British government had ordered the destruction of 10,000 cattle, and had spent the equivalent of 6.1 million dollars to compensate the owners of the destroyed animals.
