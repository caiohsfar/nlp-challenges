One response to Robert Goldwin's article on gun control says Goldwin identifies service in the militia as a necessary condition for bearing arms while it is only a sufficient condition and confuses a right to bear arms with what was a duty.
Other correspondents protest: "...I will give up my rifle when they pry my cold dead fingers from it"; that Goldwin would strip away our only sure defense of our homes; that Goldwin's agenda is "...removal of all guns from American citizens...;" and that if modern National Guardsmen were to follow Goldwin's advice, they would take home a terrifying array of modern weaponry.
