Capitalist economies of the Organization of Economic Cooperation And Development (OECD) are faced with ever-increasing costs of welfare.
Social security payments have doubled, as have healthcare costs.
The costliest item is pensions.
Solutions include reduced benefits, raising the retirement age, discontinuing cost of living increases and control of drug costs.
Demographic changes such as increases in life expectancy, and one-parent families lead to increased welfare costs.
Unemployment is a particularly difficult problem.
OECD states may not be able to afford current welfare systems in the future but merely provide a means of caring for those unable to care for themselves.
