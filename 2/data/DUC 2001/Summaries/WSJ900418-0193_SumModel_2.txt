Sixty-one percent of surveyed Americans, regardless of party, gender, race, ideology or income, favor congressional term limits.
Why?
...Because it is almost impossible to defeat an incumbent.
Most congressmen oppose the idea.
In the past three elections, 96% or more of House incumbents who ran won.
It is political axiom that people won't vote for someone they don't know.
Skewed campaign financing laws combined with franking privileges enable incumbents to make themselves known.
At the end of the 1988 elections, incumbents had $63 million left over.
Challengers were able to raise and spend a total of only $39 million.
