President Reagan has identified welfare reform as a priority during his final three years in office.
Several million families are involved in a cycle of poverty and dependency.
Taxpayers have become impatient with the huge sums of money (100 billion dollars per annum) that go to welfare with no improvement in sight.
In response, the administration has agreed to give the states leeway in devising their own plans.
There is a belief that the democrats in Congress are not serious about reform.
With the support of the governors and the public, however, the president could press the Congress to act.
