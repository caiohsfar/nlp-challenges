The calm waters of Prince William Sound have stymied efforts to disperse the 11.3 million gallons of oil spilled when the tanker Exxon Valdez hit a reef outside Valdez, the northernmost ice-free port in the U.S.
A Coast Guard spokesman said the use of chemicals to disperse and sink crude oil failed because the agents depend on rough seas to break up the oil.
Officials plan to pump the remaining oil aboard the tanker into another tanker.
Environmentalists are concerned for two reasons: the size of the spill and the fact that it is in such a sensitive and productive area.
