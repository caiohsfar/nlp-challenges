Prolonged drought, bark beetles and a rare fungus are drying out and killing brush and trees that surround many Southern California neighborhoods, creating the potential for one of the worst wildfire seasons in decades.
A map released Monday by the Los Angeles County Fire Department showed that some of the most vulnerable fire zones can be found this summer in chaparral-covered foothill and mountain-canyon slopes beside densely developed residential districts if Los Angeles and its suburbs.
Each densely thicketed acre of hillside chaparral contains about 60 tons of brush that creates about the same fuel energy as 3,750 gallons of gasoline.
