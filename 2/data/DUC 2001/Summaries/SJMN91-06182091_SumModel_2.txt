Just a day after both sides had agreed to a cease-fire, the Yugoslav army issued a "final ultimatum" to Slovenia threatening "decisive military action."
The army appeared to be beefing up its forces in Slovenia, sending additional tanks across Croatia and dispatching two warships to Koper, Slovenia.
The President of Slovenia announced "I cannot foresee Slovenia becoming a part of Yugoslavia in a democratic way.
The only possibility in this connection is her forced annexation."
The Croatian government announced that it was halting all contributions to the central government and in Zagreb, the capital, federal garrisons stood on full alert.
