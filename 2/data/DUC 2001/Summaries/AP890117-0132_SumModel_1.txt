In Long Beach, the City Council asked county prosecutors to investigate the conduct of a white policeman who was secretly filmed while he pushed an off-duty policeman through a plate-glass window.
The black Hawthorne policeman, Sgt. Don Jackson, said he set up the self-styled "sting" in Long Beach and had an NBC-News camera crew arranged to follow him to expose alleged police racism in the Los Angeles area.
Following the incident which was broadcast on NBC's national news Monday night, the police chief in Long Beach declined to comment on the incident pending an investigation.
City officials promised a thorough inquiry.
