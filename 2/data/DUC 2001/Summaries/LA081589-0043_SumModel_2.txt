A plane crash during a rain storm claimed the life of respected Congressman Larkin Smith (R-Mississippi) on 13 August 1989.
He was the second House member to die within a week.
Another plane with Congressman Mickey Leland (D-Texas) aboard was finally located at its crash site in Ethiopia also on 13 August.
Smith, a former sheriff and police chief, was returning home to Gulfport.
A team of investigators was en route to the site.
The plane, a Cessna 177, was built in 1973 and had a current inspection certificate.
The pilot, who also died in the crash, had recently undergone a physical examination.
