With Clarence Thomas about to go for confirmation as a Supreme Court justice, there are conclusions to be drawn.
The author, Peggy Noonan, believes that Thomas "made it" because he was loved by his mother, by his grandparents, and by the nuns who taught him.
Thomas, says Noonan, did notq make it on his own but has been helped all his life by affirmative action.
Noonan believes that because people helped Thomas, it shows that real change in a democracy comes from the people up, not from the government down.
She thinks that the choice of Thomas is the peoples' will.
