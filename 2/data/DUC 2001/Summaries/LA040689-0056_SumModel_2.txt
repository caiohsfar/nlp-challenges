Exxon salvage crews successfully refloated the stricken tanker Exxon Valdez on Wednesday as its former captain surrendered to authorities in New York to face criminal charges in the oil spill.
The tanker refloat went well and it was taken to a cove on uninhabited Naked Island 25 miles to the southwest.
Exxon officials were reluctant to discuss where the tanker would be taken for permanent repairs.
No people have been killed or seriously injured but oil has seriously disrupted the rich Prince William Sound fishing industry.
Animal rescue teams estimate the spill has killed several thousand birds and hundreds of sea otters.
