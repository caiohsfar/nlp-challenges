Chile has the distinction of playing host to the largest earthquake ever measured.
A San Francisco quake measuring 7.1 was comparable to the earthquake that struck Santiago and central Chile in March 1985 killing 180 people and toppling some 70,000 homes.
Chile has about 2,270 miles of its coast along the earthquake fault between the Nazca plate and the South American plate.
On May 21, 1960, an earthquake measuring 9.5 struck an area about 600 miles long in southern Chile.
About 5,000 people were killed in the sparsely populated area, most of them when the coastline dropped.
A tidal wave killed others.
