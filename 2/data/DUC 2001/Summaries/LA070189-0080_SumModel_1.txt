2300 firefighters now control an 8,200-acre brush fire in the Cleveland National Forest in Riverside County, California.
It destroyed 11 structures near Lake Elsinore.
The cost of fighting the blaze may exceed $1.5 million and structural damage could be more than $1.1 million.
The fire appears to have been caused by people near a roadside store across the Orange County line.
Investigators appealed for help to identify those responsible.
Elsewhere, a brush fire that burned 2000 acres in the Antelope Valley is now contained.
The fire claimed six structures including one home.
More than 1000 people were forced to temporarily evacuate.
