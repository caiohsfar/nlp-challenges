From mid June through early July innumerable forest fires have burned throughout the country's National Parks.
Many are small, just a few acres, while others range from 1000 to more than 2000 acres.
Their causes vary from lightening strikes to fireworks to hot vehicle exhaust pipes.
The largest seems to be a fireworks-caused blaze that swept over 2,200 acres near Yosemite National Park in California.
More than 670 firefighters from federal, state and local agencies spent $384,000 to combat this fire, which is now under control.
Elsewhere, major fires occurred in Utah, Wyoming, Montana, Michigan, Tennessee and Kentucky.
