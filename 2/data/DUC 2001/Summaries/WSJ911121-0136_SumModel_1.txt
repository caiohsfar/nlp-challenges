Roy Innis, National Chair of the Congress of Racial Equality, sees it as ironic that most black leaders are supporters of "the gun control--really, prohibition--movement"--that "sprouted from the soil of Roger B. Taney, the racist chief justice ...." Innis contends that it was only after the emancipation of black slaves that racist elements began agitating for restrictions on guns.
Gun-control legislation of the late 19th and early 20th centuries invidiously targeted blacks.
Even today only 2% of the handgun carry permits in New York City are issued to blacks who live and work in high-crime areas where they need protection.
