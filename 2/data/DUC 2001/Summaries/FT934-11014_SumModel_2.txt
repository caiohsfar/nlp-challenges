The federal government has given approval to Georgia and Wisconsin to implement pilot programs for welfare reform.
These programs may serve as experiments for the revamping of the federal welfare system.
The Wisconsin plan includes the discontinuance of payments under the program Aid to Families of Dependent Children after two years.
The Georgia plan reduces welfare payments to all able-bodied adults who refuse to work and denies any increases to families on long-term welfare who have more children.
The Clinton administration is considering a two-year limit as a standard for welfare benefits in fulfilling its promise for welfare reform.
