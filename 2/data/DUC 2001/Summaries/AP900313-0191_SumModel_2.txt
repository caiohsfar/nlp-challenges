A year after the wreck of the Exxon Valdez, the Alaskan environmental authorities report that hundreds of gallons of oil are locked up under hundreds of beaches all over Prince William Sound.
The worst is over but assessing the continuing damage has just begun.
When Exxon's $2 billion dollar cleanup ended in mid-September, it had recovered only 5 to 9 percent of the oil spilled.
Thousands of animals and birds have died.
The skipper of the Exxon Valdez is scheduled for trial and a federal grand jury issue criminal indictments against Exxon, which already faces more than 150 civil lawsuits.
