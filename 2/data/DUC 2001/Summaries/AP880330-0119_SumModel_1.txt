While there is pressure on the Census Bureau to exclude illegal aliens from its national head count, other groups urge the Bureau to adjust its final figures to account for people missed in the census--mostly minorities in urban areas.
A population expert with the Population Reference Bureau says that deleting the illegal aliens and adding an estimate of the uncounted would result in a loss of one seat for California and a gain of one seat for Georgia.
The expert also predicted that Northeast and Midwest states will lose 14 House seats following the 1990 census, continuing a trend observed for several decades.
