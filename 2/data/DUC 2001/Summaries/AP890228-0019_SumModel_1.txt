The earthquake that killed 25,00 people in Armenia pushed last year's earthquake-related death toll worldwide to the highest level since 1976 when a Chinese earthquake killed at least 10 times as many.
The annual death toll for earthquakes is about 10,000.
There were 13,000 injured and more than a half-million were left homeless in the Armenian earthquake that measured 6.8 on the Richter scale.
The main shock was followed within minutes by a second, measuring 5.8 on the Richter scale.
An earthquake of 5.0 can cause considerable damage, and the strength rises by 10 times for each whole number on the scale.
