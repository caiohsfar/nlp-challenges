The idea of a tunnel between France and England has been alive since Napoleon proposed it in 1802.
He was warned off, but since then there have been abortive starts on digging a tunnel.
Free trade is scheduled to start in 1992, and that prospect has given new impetus to the project.
Construction of a service tunnel has begun and has reached out two miles from England and one-quarter mile from the geologically more complex side.
Construction of two one-way train tunnels will start in December with completion scheduled five years from now.
