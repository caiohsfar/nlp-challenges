Researchers at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland are studying the human version of spongiform encephalopathy known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob, or CJD.
Scientists had agreed that the spongiform disease found in sheep and that found in cattle probably posed no threat to humans.
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has been rare, but they have been confounded by the relatively large outbreak of CJD in an area of Slovakia where most people raise and care for sheep.
The British are intensely interested in anything that links humans to the animal form of the spongiform disease.
