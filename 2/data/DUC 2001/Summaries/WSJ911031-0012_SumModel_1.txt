Experts are arguing the constitutionality of state-imposed congressional term limits.
Those against limits say that neither Congress nor the states may add to the age, citizenship and residency qualifications set forth in the Constitution.
Those arguing for them say that limits are not a qualification.
They do not prevent anyone from having the opportunity to serve in Congress, nor do they prevent voters from voting their ideology or party.
The California Supreme Court has ruled that term limits for state officeholders is constitutional.
The U.S. Supreme Court has reiterated that states, via the Tenth Amendment, have "the power to regulate elections."
