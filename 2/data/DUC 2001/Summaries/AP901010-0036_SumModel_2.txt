A U.S. Air Force F-111 crashed today in Saudi Arabia killing both crewmembers.
It was the fourth American aircraft to crash in three days among those deployed to this Kingdom for Operation Desert Shield.
Eight Marines are missing following the crash of two helicopters on Monday.
An Air Force F-4 reconnaissance jet also went down that day killing both crewmembers.
The F-111 was attached to the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing based at RAF Lakenheath Air Base in Britain, now deployed to Turkey for Desert Shield.
The aircraft, an F model, is the latest version of this 23 year-old swing-wing jet.
