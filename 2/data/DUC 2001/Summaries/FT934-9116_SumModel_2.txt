The battle over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) shifted to the Congressional districts this Veterans' Day weekend as members sampled public opinion at home.
Pro-NAFTA forces exulted over Vice President Gore's debate victory over Ross Perot hoping it would be decisive in the House vote next Wednesday.
One poll of debate watchers showed that support of NAFTA had shot up from 34% before the debate to 57% after it.
Meanwhile, anti-NAFTA leaders claimed 219 votes pledged against the pact (a small margin against switches) and said the battle would be won or lost in the congressmen's home districts.
