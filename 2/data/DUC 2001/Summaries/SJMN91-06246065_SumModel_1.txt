By 2 September 1991, Clarence Thomas was ready to appear, as a Republican nominee, before the Senate committee for confirming him as a Supreme Court justice.
The conversion of Thomas from liberal Democrat and Malcolm X admirer to conservative Republican took place over a period of several years beginning with his law school training at Yale in 1971-1974.
Thomas' philosophy became one of taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by the U.S. and that to rely on government for hand-outs was nothing less than slavery.
He opposed preferences given to racial minorities who suffered discrimination and called for a colorblind Constitution.
