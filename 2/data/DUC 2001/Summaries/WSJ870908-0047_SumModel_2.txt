Next month the Central Selling Organization of De Beers is raising its diamond prices by an average of ten percent.
The price of a one-carat D-flawless diamond has risen from 12,000 to 14,000 in the past eight months.
A carat weighs 200 milligrams.
De Beers decided to raise prices because of the higher demand for diamonds, particularly in Japan.
The United States is the biggest diamond market.
Japan is second, responsible in large measure to De Beers' advertising and promotion campaigns.
Two of three Japanese couples now buy diamonds, compared to one of 17 in 1967.
