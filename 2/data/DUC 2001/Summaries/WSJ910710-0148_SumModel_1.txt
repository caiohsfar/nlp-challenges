In Los Angeles a commission that investigated police tactics following the videotaped beating of Rodney King have finally released their report.
The report paints a distressing picture of brutality and racism and calls for the resignation of police chief Daryl Gates.
The commission found that a significant number of officers use excessive force against Los Angeles residents, a problem exacerbated by racism in the department.
Nearly one-quarter of 650 officers responding to a commission survey agreed that "racial bias on the part of officers toward minority citizens currently exists and contributes to a negative interaction between police and community."
