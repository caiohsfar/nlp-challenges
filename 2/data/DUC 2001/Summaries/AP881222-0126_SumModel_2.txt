Today a U.S. Air Force A-10 attack jet crashed in Britain.
The pilot ejected but his status is unknown.
This accident came two-weeks to the day after an A-10 crashed in Remscheid, Germany killing five and injuring dozens while another crashed in Tracey, Arizona, without fatalities.
With more than 1.75 million flight hours, the A-10 is statistically the safest fighter in the U.S. inventory.
It experiences an accident rate of less than 4 Class A mishaps per 100,000 flying hours.
A Class A mishap is one in which there is either a fatality or damage to an aircraft exceeding $500,000.
