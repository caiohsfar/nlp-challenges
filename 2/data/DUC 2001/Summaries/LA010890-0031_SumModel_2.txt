A controversial videotape being shown among activists nationwide shows Los Angeles police officers intentionally hurting the nonviolent demonstrators they are arresting.
They press fingers under their noses.
They dig their knuckles into protesters' necks and torque martial arts weapons around their wrists.
The law enforcement name for these techniques is "pain-compliance."
But opponents call the term a euphemism for torture.
One man's arm is contorted behind his back until it snaps.
Demonstrators have alleged police brutality at least since Freedom Riders launched their sit-down strikes in Alabama almost 30 years ago.
Police Chief Daryl Gates stands behind the painful tactics used by his department.
