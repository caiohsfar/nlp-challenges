Clarence Thomas, the Supreme Court justice, attributes his values to his grandparents who raised him in his early years.
They, more than anyone else, shaped his beliefs on self-reliance, individualism, and determination to survive under segregation.
Thomas was born of poor parents in 1948 in Pinpoint, Georgia.
He attended religious schools for a time.
He left after discovering that they were not a haven from segregation.
Thomas' real interest was the law.
He graduated from Yale Law in 1974.
He was selected for the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1990.
Thomas lives with his wife and son in Virginia.
