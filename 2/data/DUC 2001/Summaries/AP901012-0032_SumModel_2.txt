The estimated 700 Air Force "Desert Shield" warplanes are flying again after being grounded for 24 hours following a rash of accidents.
Five aircraft have been involved in fatal crashes in the gulf area since the start of Desert Shield two months ago.
Also, a C-5 transport plane crashed in West Germany while ferrying equipment to Saudi Arabia.
Twenty other aircraft have also been involved in non-fatal accidents in the gulf.
Fifteen of those were helicopters.
Air Force officials state they have not found any common cause or contributing factors.
Aircraft on operational missions near the Iraqi or Kuwait borders were not grounded.
