The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee says hearings are planned next year into how the U.S. Forest Service handled lost summer's stubborn wildfires that scorched the West.
The U.S. Forest service said 5 million acres were charred in the raging blazes, including 706,000 acres in Yellowstone.
The Forest and National Park Service spent a combined $300 million fighting the summer fires.
The most severe were in and around Yellowstone and Alaska, although there were fires in the South, California and the Pacific Northwest.
Drought conditions and high winds helped make the 1988 fires the worst in a hundred years.
