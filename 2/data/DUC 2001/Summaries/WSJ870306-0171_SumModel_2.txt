De Beers Consolidated Mines LTD, the South African concern that controls 80 percent of the world's uncut-diamond market, is thriving four years after a serious slump in market price.
Last year prices rose 14 percent and sales soared to 2.56 billion dollars, doubling the 1.26 billion of 1982.
De Beers accomplished this by convincing producers, dealers and the jewelry industry that De Beers' marketing research and advertising campaigns were essential.
Ten times each year the De Beers' Central Selling Organization, known as the Syndicate, offers its cache of diamonds to dealers in Antwerp, Tel Aviv, Bombay and New York on a take-it or leave-it-all basis.
