Last week the number two official in Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) was assassinated.
The killing of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu was allegedly ordered by Manuel Munoz Rocha, a federal deputy of the PRI and Abraham Rubio Canales, a former tourism developer with strong links to the Gulf drug cartel in the state of Tamaulipas.
Munoz Rocha has admitted to a role in the crime but put the responsibility on Rubio Canales.
Political reactionaries and drug traffickers are thought to have played a role in the killing six months ago of the PRI's reform-minded presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio.
