Tomorrow the Health Ministers of the European Union will consider Germany's request to ban British beef exports because of the fear of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, or BSE, commonly known as "mad cow disease".
The United Kingdom feels that the ban on export of live cattle and of the offspring of BSE-affected cows that has been in effect since 1990 is working well.
That ban, plus other restrictions, in addition to the lack of firm scientific evidence of a link between BSE and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that affects humans make the British confident that The European Union will deny Germany's request.
