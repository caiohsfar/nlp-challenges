A major earthquake registering 7.2 on the Richter scale shook the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific today.
It was the largest earthquake in the Solomons since a 7.4 quake on Nov. 5, 1978 and the strongest in the world in the five months.
An 8.3 quake hit the Macquarie Islands south of Australia on May 23.
The preliminary reading of 7.2 is slightly stronger than the 7.1 magnitude earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay area Oct. 17.
Major earthquakes in the Solomons usually don't cause much damage or many casualties because the area is sparsely populated and not extensively developed.
