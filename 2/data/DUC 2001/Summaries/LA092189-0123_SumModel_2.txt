On 19 September 1989, a French DC-10 aircraft with 171 passengers aboard exploded and crashed after departing N'Djamena, Chad.
A terrorist bomb was suspected as the cause.
There were no survivors.
Reasons for the bomb theory include: the wide area of the debris field, and the sudden loss of contact with the aircraft by air controllers; French officials reported the aircraft in good condition; another French aircraft flying the same route was damaged by a bomb; and France has been a recent recipient of terrorist threats.
The wife of the U.S. ambassador to Chad was among the victims.
