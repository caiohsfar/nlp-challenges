The Sheriff's Department in Los Angeles attempted to maintain a low profile following the videotaped beating of Rodney King.
Now, Sheriff Sherman Block finds his department being carefully scrutinized after deputies shot four people dead in the space of one month.
Three deputies were charged with stealing credit cards and there are allegations that the department is a haven for white supremacist gangs.
An independent commission that examined the police department following the King beating found racism, brutality, inadequate discipline, mismanagement and a "siege mentality" pitting officers against the community.
Now, critics are calling for the same kind of independent investigation of the sheriff's department.
