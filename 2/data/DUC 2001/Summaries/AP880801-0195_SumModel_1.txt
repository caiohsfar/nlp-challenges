Dale Smallwood is one of 125 Forest Service criminal investigators.
He primarily investigates arson at Missouri's Mark Twain National Forest.
It is consistently among the five forest districts with the worst arson problem and is about 90% higher than the national average.
Arsonist set 172 of this year's 296 Mark Twain fires.
Smallwood says it is part of a southern tradition to illegally burn forests.
Local subsistence farmers claim that fire helps control ticks, snakes and disease and the encroachment of trees where cattle graze.
Aesthetically, they like the smell of wood smoke and the look of a "burned clean" forest.
