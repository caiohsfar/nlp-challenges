A white Long Beach police officer that allegedly pushed a black man through a plate- glass window during an arrest that was videotaped acknowledged Friday in a hearing that he made errors in his official report.
He blamed the discrepancies on a faulty memory, saying he wrote the report three hours after the incident.
Sen. Daniel Boatwright, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on State Procurement and Expenditure Practices, called the hearing into the incident to review allegations of police misconduct in Long Beach.
The legislative committee monitors state funds disbursed to police departments by the state Police Officer Standards and Training Commission.
