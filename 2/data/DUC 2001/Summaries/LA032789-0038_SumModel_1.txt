Exxon Shipping Co. said Sunday that an unqualified mate was piloting the Exxon Valdez when it crashed, unleashing the worst oil spill in US history, and that the tanker was involved in two separate accidents that night in Prince William Sound.
Cleanup efforts continued slowly.
The Coast Guard served subpoenas on the captain, helmsman, and third mate and a team from the National Transportation Safety Board arrived Sunday to probe the cause of the accident.
Experts from wildlife and research institutes are setting up rehabilitation centers.
The Coast Guard maintains that Exxon itself will have to clean up the spill.
