The U.S. Congress this week passed the Brady Bill, its first significant gun- control law since 1968.
Last week the Senate agreed to a ban on assault weapons.
Perhaps the tide has changed in favor of gun control.
On the other hand, election results show that a strong stand on gun control does not get candidates elected, and membership in the National Rifle Association has soared in the last two years.
Although most of its members favor some degree of gun control the NRA's hard core opposes all restraints on the sale of firearms, arguing that firearms represent the best defense not only against criminals but against tyranny.
