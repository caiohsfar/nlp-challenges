Elizabeth Taylor has been hospitalized for over four weeks.
There are new complications in her case that will keep her in St John's Hospital and Health Center for another six weeks.
She was recovering nicely from the viral pneumonia that had put her life in danger, but now has contracted a bacterial pneumonia, a strain that is considered much less serious than viral because antibiotics are effective against bacteria but not against viruses.
She has also developed a blood infection known as yeast, and will remain in the hospital for intravenous therapy.
