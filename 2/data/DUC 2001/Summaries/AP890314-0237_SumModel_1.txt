Of the twelve million Americans with diabetes it is most prevalent among Native Americans, blacks, and Hispanics.
Hispanics are three times more likely to develop diabetes than the general population.
San Antonio, with a population that is 50% Hispanic is becoming the base for diabetes studies.
Researchers there believe that family studies are bringing them close to finding the gene that triggers the disease and that a natural susceptibility to diabetes is aggravated by Hispanics' diets of cheap, processed foods, lack of exercise and infrequent medical attention.
Educating elementary-school-age children about healthy diets would help reduce the number of diabetes cases.
