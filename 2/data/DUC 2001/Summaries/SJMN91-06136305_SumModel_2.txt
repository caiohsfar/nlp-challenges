This summer health professionals in the San Jose area will offer nutrition and exercise classes targeting Hispanics in an effort to educate them in the dangers of diabetes.
The incidence of diabetes among Hispanics is three times that of the general population, a fact thought to be due to a genetic predisposition aggravated by the Hispanic diet.
The instruction offered this summer concentrates on the preparation of traditional Hispanic dishes using polyunsaturated oil rather than recipes that call for lard.
Although courses for Hispanic diabetics have been offered before by the Diabetic Society, they have not been geared specifically toward the Hispanic lifestyle.
