The Coast Guard confirmed Saturday that a fresh oil sheen has seeped from the ruptured Exxon Valdez and a complete cleanup of the tanker is impossible.
Oil clinging to the tanks inside mixes with water and causes sheen that is impossible to remove unless the tanker is steam-cleaned, and nobody intends to do that.
Also, nobody in the other states wants it, and it may go to a foreign port.
The Alaska State Senate passed several bills aimed at protection from another devastating spill.
Exxon has paid out $500,000 to fishermen on claims of lost work and is processing 300 more.
