Most total eclipses get little attention because they occur over isolated areas.
Thursday's eclipse will be different.
It will be one of the longest lasting in this century, and it will put more people in the moon's shadow than any prior eclipse, and it will pass over one of the largest clusters of astronomical laboratories, affording opportunity for serious study.
Spectroscopic evidence of the presence of helium in the sun was observed during an eclipse in 1868.
During a 1919 eclipse astronomers noted the movement of a star that was the first confirmation of Einstein's theory that the path of light is bent by gravity.
