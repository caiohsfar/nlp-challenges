The value of the gems coming out of the Jwaneng mine in Botswana marks it as the world's richest diamond mine.
De Beers and the Zimbabwe government each control half of Debswana, the company that owns Jwaneng.
The De Beers' owned Finsch mine in South Africa has operated as an open pit mine since 1964, and now underground development has extended its projected life by 35 to 40 years.
The prospects of productive yields from Jwaneng and Finsch are evidence of De Beers' faith in its ability to control the diamond market in the long run despite short-term difficulties.
