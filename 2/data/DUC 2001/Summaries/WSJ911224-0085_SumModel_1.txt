Harvard Professor Robert J. Barro, after considering the many arguments for or against congressional term limits, believes those against far outweigh those in favor.
He believes the main inference in a 95% re-election rate is that officeholders are satisfying their constituents.
The only respectable argument for limits is that they would disrupt the dysfunctional aspects of the seniority system.
Seniority provides better committee assignments, which lead to greater special interest fund raising and the power to control government largess, often dispersed at the expense of districts represented by junior legislators.
Committee term limits may improve the functioning of government.
