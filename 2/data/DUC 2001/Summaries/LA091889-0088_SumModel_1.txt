Third World debtors had to pay $50.1 billion more to service their debt to the United States and other creditors last year than they received in new loans "a major drain on their already cash-strapped economies" the World Bank reported Sunday.
The bank also reported that, despite the relatively buoyant economic growth in most industrial countries, developing countries turned in a decidedly mixed performance, ranging from a mini-boom in Southeast Asian economies to further impoverishment in Africa.
The net cash drain from the debtor counties to the richer ones began in 1984.
Until then, richer countries had provided more in new loans to Third World Nations that those countries paid back.
