On 11 January 1989, authorities questioned an injured pilot of a Boeing 737 that crashed on this date while en route from London to Belfast.
The crash killed 44 people and injured 82.
No explanation was given as to why a functioning engine was shut down while a malfunctioning one was allowed to operate.
Crosswiring of warning systems may have been a contributing cause.
Flight recorders indicate that the crew shut down the wrong engine.
In a related development, the FBI is investigating possible falsified records at a factory which makes parts for the CFM56 engine, the type on board the aircraft.
