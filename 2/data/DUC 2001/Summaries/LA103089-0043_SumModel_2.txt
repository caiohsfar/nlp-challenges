Temperatures in the mid-60s, 53% humidity, and wind wilted the 8,000 runners in the 12th Old Style/Chicago marathon on Sunday, which began at Daley Plaza and wound through flat city streets.
Organizers insist this race is world-class with the world's richest purse, although it lost its sponsor in 1986, staged no race in 1987, and no drug testing is done.
Paul Davies-Hale of England won in 2:11:25, the slowest winning time since 1982.
It was his first marathon.
Lisa Weidenbach of Washington won among the women in 2:28:15.
Each won $50,000.
Second place winners got $30,000 and third place $20,000.
Wheelchair races are included.
